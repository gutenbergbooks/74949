<h2 class='nobreak'>I</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>H</span>orace Lestrange was intent
upon his occupation; he was throwing
stones into the lake. He did it with skill and
success; he made each stone jump four times,
but he was using only his outer layer of attention;
his inner self was turning over and over
again a personal problem; he would have said
he was thinking it out, but this was a mistake.
The case was very plain and required no
thought; he was only feeling it over, probing
sensation to find how much weight it would
bear, and at what point his heart would cry
out to him to stop. Ten years ago he had lost
his wife, after one year’s marriage. Perhaps,
if she had lived, he would have grown tired
of her; but she was very beautiful, and she
had died when love was new and every golden
day of her presence a thing divine and separate,
intolerable to lose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had left him something; instead of her
love and her ripened youth, she had given him
a baby son; he had put the child in his sister’s
care and gone abroad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Annette used to go to church very devoutly,
and Horace went to please her. He tried to
suppose that Providence was in the right, but
he said to his oldest friend (and this was the
only comment he was heard to make upon his
grief):</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems to me, Bambridge, love is rather a
let in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bambridge cleared his throat sympathetically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A deuced lot of things are,” he muttered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Annette had always thought Bambridge
rather cynical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Time heals wounds, but it leaves scars. Ten
years had done a great deal for Horace Lestrange.
There was no mark of his great
grief left; but although time works very well
as a narcotic, it is not stimulating; it had not
renewed Horace’s youth. He did not think
of love now; he thought of marriage--comfortable,
consoling marriage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl who had suggested this idea to him
was a thoroughly nice girl, pretty, well-educated,
and kind-hearted. She had been very
good to Horace; they had rowed on the lake
together, and her ways were energetic without
hardness, and swift with grace. They had
climbed some of the surrounding peaks side by
side, and she had shown admirable characteristics--quietness,
pluck, instantaneous obedience,
and endurance. She was a good companion
(she challenged no comparison with
Annette, who was helpless, clinging, and
thoroughly silly, the kind of woman whom--if
she dies soon enough--a man never forgets).
Edith’s hair and eyes were dark; she
had a full sweet mouth and a round chin. She
was quite thirty and she wouldn’t expect
romance.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last stone failed to jump four times;
perhaps it didn’t agree with Horace that there
is a time limit for romance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would be an excellent thing for the
boy,” said Lestrange, putting his hands in his
pockets. “Etta of course is a good woman;
clever, plenty of tact, but she is so managing.
I never knew such a woman; she sponges one
up. She has been everything to the little chap
though for the last eight years. I hope he
won’t make a fuss at leaving her. I don’t
think he will; Edith is good with kids. Well,
I’ll go and look her up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went to look her up. She was usually
easy to discover when Lestrange wanted her.
She did not run after him, as a sillier woman
would have done, neither did she run away
from him, as young girls sometimes run from
their lovers, but when he looked for her she was
there. She sat under a big ilex tree on the
terrace of the hotel garden. It was not easy
to remember that it was an hotel, for once it
had been an old Italian palace, and something
of its ancient dignity remained. The lake lay
at its foot, a vast and shimmering expanse of
silver and azure. The mountains were half
withdrawn into vague shadows; sometimes
moonstone and sometimes purple, and when
the wind blew aside their thin veil of mist, the
sun shone over slopes vivid, luminous and
green.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Around Edith Walton were huge bushes of
camellias, red and white and very splendid. A
mad riot of roses flung itself over a pergola.
In the distance a magnolia tree slowly opened
wonderful flowers to the sun--flowers that
seemed like the birth of spiritual treasures,
white cloistered buds filled with aromatic
fragrance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith sat quite still with her hands in her
lap; there was something expectant in her appearance;
it seemed part of the general hush.
The wind had dropped suddenly and the
tiny village lay embosomed on quivering water
lines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith knew who was coming towards her,
as flowers know the quickening soft rain of
spring, and as the ocean knows the dominance
of the tides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ve got an awfully jolly corner,” said
Lestrange rather awkwardly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are so many awfully jolly corners
here,” said Edith. Then she smiled at him,
the tender smile of a woman who laughs in
secret triumph at the man she loves; she lets
him think he is concealing his purpose from
her, but she smiles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you weren’t going away to-morrow,”
Lestrange began. He thought he was
leading up to his goal with extraordinary skill
and subtlety. “Must you really?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith hesitated; he would have to put it
better than that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think my aunt has made all her arrangements,”
she said. Then she looked away towards
the lake over his shoulder. “I shall be
sorry to leave--all this,” she murmured
quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see why you can’t stay with me,”
said Lestrange, sitting down on the seat beside
her. “I mean always.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was certainly not putting it very well.
Edith tried to believe that he was; she wanted
to believe it. She looked at him, and her lips
quivered. She was not an emotional woman;
he had taken good care to find that out, but
her dark eyes looked strange and stormy. She
seemed as if she was feeling something
strongly, almost more than she could bear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want me very much?” she murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, of course he wanted her. If you ask
a woman to marry you, you must want her unless
you are a young fool under the influence of
glamour. There was no glamour. Horace
had never pretended in his life, and he did not
pretend now. He simply said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would make me very happy if you would
be my wife, Edith.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should like so much to make you very
happy,” said Edith. Then, suddenly, inconsequently,
and very foolishly, she burst into
tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t, my dear--don’t,” he exclaimed hurriedly.
He tried to take her hands from her
face, but she would not let him. He looked
at her in bewilderment; she shook with these
astonishing sobs; and she was a most sensible
woman, and thirty. He could not understand
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kissed the clenched hands which covered
her face, and almost as suddenly the sobs
ceased. She drew in her breath with a quick
sound. He walked to the balustrade and
began to whistle. They were in a very secluded
part of the gardens, but one never
knew. No! fortunately there was no one in
sight. What an extraordinary, lovely scene it
was! Perhaps Edith would stop crying soon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did; she brushed the tears from her eyes
and laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, how silly you must think me!” she said.
“And I’m thirty--you know I’m thirty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think this is the third time that you have
told me you are,” cried Horace. He came and
sat down beside her again. She did not make
him feel uncomfortable any more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do smoke,” said Edith quickly. “I know
you’re dying to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks, if I may.” He lit; a cigarette.
And she saw with a sudden sinking of her heart
that his hands were steady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is the little chap at home,” he said,
turning his eyes to her with a restored friendliness.
“You’re sure you won’t mind him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I shall love him!” said Edith. “Do
you know--you must not be jealous, but that
is half the reason why I am so--why I am going
to marry you, you know!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Horace was not jealous. He was very
pleased, and he said so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what,” Edith asked anxiously, “will
your sister say, Horace?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my sister!” stammered Lestrange.
“Do you think she will mind very much?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You darling stupid!” cried Edith. “She’ll
mind most horribly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she blushed; she hadn’t meant to call
him “darling.” She looked at him anxiously,
but he had not noticed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Jove, I believe she will; you’re right,
Edith. I’m afraid she’ll cut up frightfully
rough! I thought I had managed to think it all
out--about you, you know, and the little chap
and me--and Annette, my dead wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke these last words in a voice she had
never heard him use before. But he spoke
them bravely and honestly, with his eyes on
hers. Her courage leapt to meet his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” she said quickly, “I want you
to behave as if I had loved her too. I want
you to talk to me of her, to let her share our
life, or rather to let me share yours and hers.
I want you never to be afraid that I do not
understand. I come to you to give you all the
help and comfort that I can, but I come to you
knowing that she has your heart.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Lestrange kissed her. The last hesitation
fell away from this new purpose, the last
cloud melted. His heart went out in friendship
and gratitude to this woman who did not
seek to rob him of his past. There was a
moment’s splendid recognition between them,
as strong as passion and as kind as love. Then
the breathless hush of the air broke in a chill
and sudden shower; they passed through the
drenched garden quickly into the big hotel.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>II</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>W</span>hen Miss Lestrange received the announcement
of her brother’s engagement
she replied by return of post, congratulating
him on his prospective happiness.
She called it prospective, but she allowed
that it was happiness. She offered to give
up her residence at Mallows, Horace’s place in
the country, and suggested that perhaps she
could take a villa by the seaside.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This,” she wrote, “would be very suitable
for Leslie as well.” She took entirely for
granted that she should keep the boy. Then
she said to herself: “Edith Walton! What
extraordinary people Horace picks up! One
has never heard of her! There was a Lady
Walton I remember meeting at Bournemouth;
her husband probably got knighted for patent
biscuits, or some vulgar charity; the Lindleys
knew her. I will call on the Lindleys.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Horace returned to London he found
his home, as usual, the perfection of order.
He was not a rich man, and he did not desire
luxury or extravagance. He had never needed
to desire them, for his sister had that genius
for management which results in other people’s
comfort. She oiled the wheels of life for her
brother, and as yet she had charged him nothing
for the oil. She was dressed for going out,
but on his arrival she laid her card-case and
parasol on the table and gave him her cheek
to kiss. Miss Lestrange had been a plain,
angular girl, without charms; but she was
a distinguished-looking middle-aged woman
with a pleasant manner. Her pleasant manner
entirely hid from the world that she had
a will of iron and an absorbing passion for her
little nephew. She was famous for her kind
heart, and made an excellent <span class='it'>confidante</span>;
people talked of her as “a dear, kind old thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her brother looked at her a little nervously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have received my letter?” said Miss
Lestrange, sitting down again, and drawing
on her gloves. “But, of course, there is a great
deal to be talked over, isn’t there? We
needn’t begin now. Do you want a meal or
anything? Or do they give it to you on the
train? It is so long since I have been on the
Continent, but I understand that in America
you can be shaved and have your corns cut,
probably simultaneously, as you travel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I’ll ring for tea,” said Horace.
“Where is the boy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid he is out with Mr. Flinders.
I should have kept him in, of course, to meet
you; but Mr. Flinders said it was such a perfect
afternoon it seemed a pity to keep him in,
and I never like to interfere with the tutor’s
arrangements. Leslie sent you his love.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thanks,” said Horace, a little dryly. He
fidgeted about the room; he hardly knew quite
what he expected from Etta, but, by Jove!
she needn’t go on smoothing her gloves--it
made him feel cold between the shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope the cake is not heavy,” said his sister,
rising to pour out his tea. “Mrs. Devon can’t
make cakes--it is her only weakness; but there
are some rather nice pink things over there
from the confectioner’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Horace cleared his throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you would take off your things,
Etta,” he said with sudden irritation, “or not
look as if you were being kept in by force, and
meant to go out the moment I had swallowed
my tea; it makes me nervous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nervous, my dear boy? Lestranges are
never nervous. What is the matter with you?
I was going out calling, and I supposed you
would want to go upstairs and tidy after your
journey. But, of course, if you are nervous,
and have anything on your mind⁠--”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Etta began unbuttoning her gloves. Her
brother groaned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, hang it all, Etta; I’d rather wait till
after dinner!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just as you like,” said Miss Lestrange.
“I hope Miss--er--Walton, isn’t it?--is quite
well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, Edith is all right, thanks. You
might tell them, Etta, to let the little chap
come into my study when he gets in from his
walk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, of course, Horace!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It may have been intention, or it may have
been one of those fortunate accidents which
happen to well-trained fighters, but Miss Lestrange’s
attention was suddenly caught by
a crooked picture. She turned back to a portrait
of Annette hanging over the mantelpiece.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not hung quite straight,” she said in
her pleasant, commonplace voice. “There,
that’s better! Is there anything more you
want, Horace?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her brother’s answer was made from his
teacup; it sounded very like “Damn!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Horace continued to be extremely nervous.
He had meant to go and see Edith after
dinner; she and her aunt, Lady Walton, had
returned to town with him, but he couldn’t
go to Edith, having arranged nothing whatever,
and not even having mentioned that he
intended to keep his boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All through dinner Etta held the conversation
and guided it as she chose. Mr. Flinders,
the tutor, responded admirably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Lestrange had a perfect tone with the
tutor; she treated him with that deference
which marks the difference in social value.
Her delicate flattery was a restraint; it put
him at once on the footing of an inferior position
where she could afford to be delightful to
him without his ever meeting her on her own
level. It was too fine for condescension, too
gracious for patronage; it was an “invulnerable
nothing”; and yet you could no more have
passed it than have walked through bayonets;
and there was this added attraction, that the
bayonets were garlanded with flowers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was such a pity Leslie behaved so badly
this afternoon,” Miss Lestrange began. “Mr.
Flinders felt that such direct disobedience
must be punished, especially when it led to
such a decided risk as the boy’s playing with
whooping-cough children in the Park. So instead
of being allowed to come and see you,
Horace, he had to be packed off, supperless,
to bed; but you will go up after dinner, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should have gone up before,” interrupted
Horace, “but they said⁠--”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I think authority must be upheld,”
said his sister. “You see, dear Horace, Mr.
Flinders had already warned Leslie about the
punishment.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked across at her brother, as if to say
that the punishment was an absurd blunder of
Mr. Flinders, which they must overlook, because
although he was a very clever fellow,
of course, and a clergyman’s son, and really
quite a gentleman, still⁠--</p>

<p class='pindent'>Horace understood the look, and dropped
the subject. He was a man who took almost
everything very easily; but not quite everything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Flinders began to make some explanation,
which Miss Lestrange promptly checked.
She asked his advice about a book, and somehow
or other Leslie’s punishment remained
the tutor’s blunder, though this was the first
time he had ever heard of it. He had probably
misunderstood something Miss Lestrange
had said to him; she had often observed that
she was not a lucid talker; there were certain
advantages which Mr. Flinders had had, and
she had not, and this made it such a comfort
to listen to him! Possibly this was one of the
occasions in which the disadvantages had told.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After dinner Horace went upstairs to see
his boy; there were traces of tears on the child’s
face, and he looked pathetically like his dead
mother. He flung his arms around his
father’s neck and began to sob. Leslie had
inherited Annette’s weak constitution; he was
a highly-strung, delicate little boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, daddy, don’t--don’t--don’t!” he
sobbed. “Oh, please, dear daddy, don’t! I
will be good if you won’t marry her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father’s face grew suddenly very stern;
he had meant to be the first to tell his son about
Edith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear old chap,” he said tenderly, sitting
down on the bed beside the boy. “Edith is
such a jolly girl; you will like her. Why,
she’s pretty and kind, and awfully fond of
boys! You have no idea what fun we’ll have.
She has asked you to go with her to-morrow
to the Zoo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been to the Zoo,” said Leslie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A firm little line came around his mouth.
It used to come round his mother’s when she
meant to get her way and she did not find it
easy. Horace had not seen it often enough
to remember it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, daddy, don’t make me go with her; I
want to go away with auntie--oh, I do want
to go away with auntie!” The sobs began to
shake him again. “I have always had auntie,”
he cried. “You see, daddy, I’ve always had
auntie!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, boy, you don’t want to go away from
me?” asked his father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a moment’s constrained silence,
and then the child dragged himself out of his
father’s arms and threw himself face downwards
on his pillow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I do,” he muttered petulantly. “I
won’t stay with this new woman! I do want
to go away!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lines of pain on Horace’s face deepened.
His heart seemed to contract as he looked at
the golden curls on the pillow, and remembered
those long golden curls he had played with
and kissed. For a moment he turned away,
regretful, sick, and undesirous as the child himself
of “this new woman.” Then his manhood
reasserted itself, and he remembered that this
was after all only a childish fit of ignorant
tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was not angry with the child; it did
not occur to him to ask him who had given
him this cruel fear of Edith. There were a
good many things that never occurred to
Horace Lestrange. They might have been
convenient things to do; possibly they might
have made life easy and happy for him, only
he did not do them, that was all; he could not
make the child tell tales.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was some one to be very angry with;
that was a simplification. It might be Etta,
but Lestrange was slow to think so. Hadn’t
she congratulated him at once? And besides,
he couldn’t think that Etta could poison a
child’s mind. Perhaps it was that fool Flinders;
he seemed a perfectly incompetent chap,
and he might possibly have some sentimental
theories on step-mothers. Anyhow, he would
go downstairs and talk to Etta; meanwhile
he stooped over the child and shook his
shoulder gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t cry, old man,” he said quietly. “I
promise you, you will like this new friend.
She doesn’t want to take your mother’s place,
or anything; she is just a new friend. To-morrow
you shall see her, and tell me what
you feel. You needn’t go to the Zoo. Aunt
Etta isn’t going away at present, and you shall
see her whenever you like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Flinders said there was going to be
great changes,” sobbed the boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The father closed his lips suddenly; there
was going to be one great change--and that
would be Mr. Flinders. He recalled his
sister’s glance at dinner; evidently Etta
thought the man a fool too. He felt vaguely
relieved to have found out that it was Flinders.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>III</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>E</span>tta was sitting in the library doing
church embroidery on a frame; it was a
thing she did extremely well; in fact, she was
a woman who never did anything badly; if
there were possibilities of ignorance in her, she
avoided those fields in which they might be betrayed.
Horace did not want to talk to her
while she worked; he was never quite sure that
he had her whole attention; she might be counting
stitches or planning patterns, and so miss
his points. He knew, however, that it does
not do to start an important conversation with
a woman by establishing a grievance, so he did
not ask her to stop; he merely found refuge in
a succession of cigarettes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was it a surprise to you, Etta,” he began
in an off-hand tone, “to hear of my engagement?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Etta took up a thread of pink silk, and then
decided for pale blue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know that engagements ever surprise
me,” she replied. “If men can afford to
marry, and there is no other impediment, they
generally do; and if they are attractive to
women, they always do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean if women attract them?” he
interjected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear boy,” said his sister, moving the
frame slightly more under the electric light,
“it never does to confuse cause and effect. If
women want to marry a man, he marries. In
your case, of course, there was some protection
provided you remained at home; the rest was
merely a question of time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Horace did not like this way of putting the
matter at all; in the first place, it was an insult
to Edith, and in the second place it was
an insult to his own intelligence. He had
thought the thing out so often, and had acted
so entirely as a free agent; and yet the more
emphasis he laid on this fact, the more plainly
he saw the pleasant, unconvinced smile upon
his sister’s face; besides, it wasn’t the point of
the discussion; they seemed strangely incapable
of reaching the point of the discussion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sure when you see Edith,” he said at
last, “you will feel that I have made a most
desirable choice.” He tried to put it as baldly
as possible, for he did not wish Etta to think
he had been swayed by glamour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Walton!” said his sister slowly: “who are
the Waltons? Has the yellow silk skein fallen
at your feet, Horace?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know that they are anybody in particular,”
said Horace, vaguely uncomfortable;
“she’s an orphan, you know, and Lady
Walton, her aunt, is an extremely clever,
amusing woman. Edith has not gone in for
Society much, she’s so fond of travel, and her
aunt’s rather an invalid, so I imagine they
have always lived extremely quietly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t remember,” said Etta, “whether it
was biscuits or soap the Lindleys told me; perhaps
it was soap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was soap?” said Horace, now
thoroughly irritated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What the man Walton, you know, was
knighted for,” said his sister, calmly stitching
at a wild rose. “Is she a lady by birth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The question did not arise,” said Horace
rather grimly, “and if such questions do not
arise, the references are usually satisfactory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Usually,” agreed his sister, “but not
always, Horace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You speak in a very mysterious way, my
dear. May I ask if you have a secret up your
sleeve--what do they call those things in the
‘Family Herald’?--‘an ugly secret.’ Have
you discovered that Lady Walton’s name was
Smith?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know what her name was,” said
Miss Lestrange, and for a moment she pushed
the screen away from her. “The whole family
seem slightly obscure, but I supposed Miss
Walton’s aunt could hardly be a person of
much discrimination (I am sure I can be revealing
no secret to you, my dear Horace, as
you must know all about the thing already)--but
how could any one who was a lady allow
her niece to compromise herself quite as madly
on the eve of her first London season? People
of our sort don’t do that kind of thing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pray explain yourself, Etta,” said Horace,
getting up and standing in front of the mantelpiece,
where he could look down on his sister.
“I know nothing of what you say. Perhaps
you have heard some malicious or stupid gossip
which it is your duty to tell me, and mine
to contradict.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hardly think you could do anything so
foolish as to contradict gossip, my dear
Horace, unless you wish to revive it; but I will
certainly tell you what the Lindleys told me,
and doubtless Edith will find it easy to explain.
She was found staying on the Lake of Como--at
the same place, I believe, where your engagement
took place--with a disreputable
woman--a woman about whose career there
was no shadow of doubt. The Lindleys knew
all about her, and this woman and Miss
Walton were requested to leave the hotel.
The peculiar part of the whole story is that
the aunt and Miss Walton’s maid left previously,
having apparently discovered the
character of Miss Walton’s companion, and
leaving the niece alone with her. I told the
Lindleys, of course, that there must be some
perfectly obvious explanation, but the fact remains
the girl never did come out, and that
she and her aunt have traveled about more or
less ever since. I am, I must confess, a little
disappointed that you have not got an explanation
for me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There will be no difficulty about that,” said
Horace quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“None, of course,” said his sister in courteous
agreement. Then there was a pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Etta continued to embroider, but she felt
flushed and uncomfortable. So far she had
simply skirmished; the real battle lay ahead.
She had counted on her brother opening the
subject, but he opened nothing. He stood before
the closed door of her future apparently
with far more comfort and unconcern than
she did. Even a clever woman is at a disadvantage
with a silent man; she has no
weapon to pierce his armor. Her final onslaught
had not disconcerted him so much as
she had hoped. Evidently she was going to
have to deal with an intelligent woman; no
mere fool could have won such entire confidence
from her brother, and without any of
the distortions of love. Miss Lestrange saw
perfectly well that Horace was not in love with
the girl; she had guessed this from his letter--but
she knew it the moment she saw him.
It gave her unconcealed satisfaction, but at
the same time it was puzzling that he seemed
unshaken after her little story; she was certain
of all the facts. She knew the importance
of the unembellished, and she never
risked an exaggeration with her brother. Lestranges
did not understand exaggeration--at
least, the male branch never did; if they found
you inaccurate they had a tiresome habit of
never accepting what you said without proof.
Horace had never found Etta inaccurate; he
had only once or twice thought she was mistaken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Lestrange fidgeted for a few minutes,
then she said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you think that a woman, however innocent,
who is under such a cloud, is fit to be in
the position of mother to Annette’s boy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will make every inquiry,” said Horace
reflectively, “and, by the bye, Etta, Flinders
must go. I don’t approve of Flinders.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think myself,” said Etta, “that he has
taken rather too much upon his shoulders
lately. You see, you were so long abroad, and
yet you were his master. Whereas I was
hardly in a position to dictate to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall speak to him to-night,” said
Horace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Lestrange put down her embroidery
and faced her brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Horace,” she said, “I hope you found
Leslie reconciled to the idea of this great
change? I did not like to speak to him about
it myself. I am not an emotional woman, but
my feelings for you and for your boy have
been very strong. I did not trust myself to
say much. I told Mr. Flinders that nothing
must be said to prejudice him against his
future step-mother, and then I left the subject
to you to explain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He does not seem to have carried out your
orders, Etta.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my dear Horace,” she cried with a
sudden note of anxiety in her voice, “how
dreadful--how <span class='it'>very</span> dreadful!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is exceedingly tiresome, of course, but I
fancy the boy will soon take to Edith; she is
clever with children.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Lestrange rose to her feet; she looked
agitated, plain, and awkward; her hands
trembled and she gathered her sewing materials
together. (There was the making of
an excellent actress about Miss Lestrange.)</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear boy,” she said solicitously, “I
haven’t liked to bother you about it while you
were away--these things are so intangible--but
Dr. Bossage isn’t quite pleased with Leslie’s
health, his constitution is so delicate; he
takes after Annette. You know I have been
almost excessively careful of him. I spoke to
Bossage last week about the impending change,
and he said it would be a very serious matter
unless the boy really took to her. I blame
myself, Horace, for not having conquered my
feelings and spoken to Leslie strongly in her
favor; but the Lestranges have always been
sincere; there was this story against her. I
was too cautious. I waited. I am afraid I
may have done incalculable harm--” She
stopped breathless. Horace eyed her gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that all?” he asked as she finished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You had better go and see Bossage yourself,”
said Miss Lestrange; “he strongly advised
my taking the boy to live in the country
or by the sea for a year or two, till he becomes
definitely strong. I daresay you remember
my having mentioned it to you in my last letter?
Of course, should you think it best, I will
take him with pleasure. I have already told
you that I will send to Mallows for all my little
things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know you needn’t do that, Etta;
Mallows is as much your home as mine.
Edith and I will run down when we like, but
I most certainly wish you to remain there,”
interrupted her brother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Lestrange bowed her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is like your generosity, Horace,” she
replied slowly. “I accept. Now I am sure
you wish to go and see Edith before it is too
late.” (“Edith” was a distinct concession, but
Miss Lestrange knew the value of inconclusive
concessions.) “By-and-by you will tell me
what you two are going to do about the boy.
I hope, even if you decide to disregard Bossage,
you will let him come away with me after
your marriage, till you get settled, and it is
convenient for you to have him back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After all, she hadn’t put him in a corner--she
hadn’t tied him down nor asked him
for a promise, or made a scene. She had done
none of the things he had feared; she had
merely given him “rope enough to hang himself,”
and then let him go to accomplish the
performance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Horace did not know what had happened;
he felt, indeed, vaguely uncomfortable.
There was the strange story about Edith--pure
folly but still strange--and there was
this news of his boy’s health and his evident
frightened horror of the new relationship.
He might go and see Bossage, but he had a
horror of going to see doctors--a horror born
of terrible useless hours, while hideous, unavailing
efforts were being made to stop the
feeble ebbing of Annette’s little life. No, he
wasn’t going to see doctors! But Edith was
so keen to have the little chap. It was hard
on Edith. (He did not consider it was hard
upon himself--he was not apt to take that view
of misfortune.) They had talked about him
for hours, and it had all been so natural and
right and easy--their future life together had
been built around Annette’s son; the picture
seemed suddenly a piece of vacant canvas
brushed out by ineffaceable hygienic whitewash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was only one thing to be done. He
would dismiss Flinders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Flinders had, perhaps, some right to
consider himself in after years an ill-used man.
He had been given notice with implacable and
relentless abruptness; no explanation had been
given or listened to. If Lestrange had not
been so extremely quiet, Mr. Flinders would
have thought he was dealing with a man who
was in a dangerous rage; as it was, he merely
clung to the idea (which was not originally
perhaps his own) that Lestrange was a well-meaning
fool, governed by a tyrannical and
scheming adventuress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Lestrange, who was most sympathetic
about it next morning, assured him of the fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is natural,” she said graciously, “for
people like yourself, Mr. Flinders, with your
high ideals and great independence of spirit,
to be surprised at such strong and regrettable
influence wielded over a man like my brother,
but the Lestranges are well known to be, as
a family, very susceptible to women. I regret
your going extremely. I spoke to my
brother for you, but I am sorry to say I found
him quite intractable on that and many other
subjects. You must write and let me know
how you are getting on. Life is so difficult,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Lestrange was fond of speaking of
Life or Destiny as being gigantic monsters
with invincible powers, and yet there were
times when she manipulated these great forces
very easily. Mr. Flinders left her more
struck than ever by her genuine qualities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I daresay she will miss me too,” he said
to himself with pleasant regretfulness. “I
may have been of some use to her,” and there
was no doubt that in this particular deduction
Mr. Flinders was right.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IV</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>L</span>ady Walton was a woman who
never did anything with her hands. She
was content to sit for hours at a time thinking--“doing
nothing,” her acquaintances
called it. Certain hours in the day she read,
but she never opened a modern book of any
kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have a feeling,” she said to her niece,
“that they would revive a very painful experience
I once received of a kitchen-maid in
hysterics. People used to accept life and
make their appeal to the intellect; now they
spend their time screaming at natural laws and
living for the emotions. It is a mysterious
modern compulsion which used to be called
selfishness. When I hear you begin to talk of
your temperament, my dear Edith, I shall
cease to ask you to run my errands.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith stroked her aunt’s hand and smiled
at her; but she was preoccupied; she was expecting
Horace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes, Edith, you disappoint me. I
have an impression that all the wisdom of all
the ages, including my own, would have less
effect upon your intelligence than the sound
(I suppose they have no creak) of an ordinary
pair of Bond Street boots.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he is rather late,” said Edith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is talking with his sister,” suggested
Lady Walton. “I must congratulate you, my
dear, in having chosen a husband who has complete
ignorance of women. It is a very
valuable attribute nowadays, when women have
no restraint and men no manners. Horace
is doubtless explaining to Miss Lestrange
what an excellent arrangement his marriage
will be for everybody concerned; and Miss Lestrange
is turning his attention to awkward details.
I hope you are prepared for complications,
Edith; the maternal instinct of maiden
aunts is a very fierce thing to combat. Do you
realize that she may refuse to let the boy go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl moved restlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she can’t!” she murmured. “After all,
Horace is very strong; he’s not a weak man,
auntie.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is nothing so vulnerable as some
kinds of strength,” said Lady Walton, with
a sigh, “or so invulnerable as some kinds of
weakness. What is tyranny but weakness
playing on generosity, and how long do you
suppose it can last? It can last as long as the
generosity.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith shivered a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he’ll think of me,” she said. “He
knows how I want his child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll think of you,” said her aunt very
slowly; “yes, he’ll think of you, Edith; but
thought doesn’t compel--there is only one
compulsion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was surgery for the sake of healing, but
the knife struck deep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Walton sat quite still; she did not
attempt to touch or soothe the girl; she did
not even look at her. After a while she said
reflectively:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you had been ten years, or even five
years younger, Edith, I should have forbidden
this marriage; but you have learnt self-control;
you know what you are marrying for--and
you won’t fail to receive it, because you
are not fool enough to spend your time crying
for the moon. Crying for the moon is an injurious
element in married life. It is not the
kind of thing one gets.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith lifted her eyes to her aunt’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have asked myself sometimes why I am
doing it,” she said, and her voice sounded hard
and strained. “I am not a fool of twenty, as
you say--but Horace could have given me the
moon, only he has given it already. And--and
what is so much more, auntie, I could have
given him back the moon’s equivalent. I
could have filled his life with happiness, and
he can’t take it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” said Lady Walton, “do you regret
what you are going to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith hesitated a moment. Then she said:
“Yes, and I’m going to do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I hear the taxi which is the preliminary
of the Bond Street boots,” said her
aunt, “and if you will excuse me, my dear,
I will go to bed. It is a quarter to ten; you
will send him away at half-past, cry for half-an-hour,
and then go to bed.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I sha’n’t cry!” said Edith, rising and
resting her head on the mantelpiece. “I don’t
cry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” replied Lady Walton, “that’s a great
pity, my dear, because in that case you won’t
sleep. However, we each have our own
method.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed a long time to Edith before the
owner of the Bond Street boots came upstairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was a woman with a strong sense of
humor, and so she spent the time laughing because
it seemed so extremely amusing to receive
a man who is going to marry you with a
little more than the kindness of a friend and
a little less than the freedom of a lover. What
made it seem so especially funny to Edith was
that she loved him; and it did not occur to her
any the less sad because it was funny, or any
the less funny because it was sad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Horace entered, looking glum; he was feeling--as
he phrased it--“a bit of a fool.” An
ecstatic or an anxious welcome would have annoyed
him. Edith met his eyes smiling, but
she did not rise from her chair nor did she burst
into nervous questions; she merely said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My aunt told me to tell you, Horace, that
she was suffering from an acute attack of discretion,
so that she would be unable to see you
this evening; it is usually followed by a relapse
into curiosity, which she expects to take place
to-morrow; and you may stay until half-past
ten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Horace sat down beside her and smiled.
It was really very peaceful and jolly; the place
seemed full of flowers; it was almost like their
being together at Como. Edith was dressed
in pale soft green; he liked it extremely. He
took her hand and held it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’m rather glad we’re alone,” he
said. “I’m afraid I’m awfully late, but I
couldn’t help it. Etta kept me such a confounded
time--bush-beating--and then I had
to send off the tutor, who’s a beast--and has
frightened the little chap silly about you;
and altogether it’s been rather a rough passage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor Horace,” said Edith softly, “what a
shame! But you mustn’t be worried; we’ll
straighten it all out between us somehow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you won’t like it--you won’t like it,
Edith!” he exclaimed, looking at her with helpless,
appealing eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a look which women who love know
how to answer--when they are loved in return.
Edith drew a sudden quick breath, then she
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear boy, I didn’t expect we’d get
everything all at once; it wouldn’t be any fun
if we did. Why, it’s a regular campaign, and
this is the first skirmish.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, it’s defeat, Edith,” he said, more
quietly. “I’m afraid it’s defeat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then tell me,” she answered. “I can bear
defeat, Horace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked into her honest, gallant eyes and
blessed her; he blessed her for her courage;
and he might have kissed her if he had thought
about it. He told her about the boy’s delicacy
and the doctor’s orders. She asked him one
question:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you hadn’t met me, could you have
lived with him in the country?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no!” said Horace. “I couldn’t get up
to town and back from Mallows for my work--we
should have had to be parted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were both silent for a little, then she
drew his hand up against her cheek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ll go down all your holidays to Mallows,”
she said. “Every single one, Horace!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But don’t you--don’t you mind?” he stammered,
puzzled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith turned her eyes on his, still smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’ve got to mind,” she murmured; “but
may I just see him first?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of course, to-morrow,” said Horace
quickly. “I think the whole thing’s rather
devilish, you know, Edith. I can’t quite follow
it. They never told me before about the
little chap, and they seem to have turned him
against the very idea of you and all that, you
know; and he’s such a loving little fellow
really, and he said he wanted to go away and
leave me⁠--”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Horace’s voice broke and Edith winced.
She looked away from him, and he recovered
himself in a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And Etta has got hold of some wild tale
about you,” he went on. “I don’t like to speak
to you about it, dear--it’s all a stupid bottomless
impertinence--but, of course, I had to tell
her I’d ask you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You may ask me anything you like,
Horace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, darling! Do you know I
always thought you were awfully sensible, but
I never knew how sensible you were before
to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith gave a long, low laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sensible? I’m so glad you think I’m sensible,
Horace!” she murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I do,” he said with admiring emphasis.
“I think you’re the most sensible woman I
ever met.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith stopped laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the story, Horace?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, were you ever on the Lake of Como
staying with rather an odd person--ten years
ago?” he began. He had released her hands
now and sat looking red and foolish and staring
in front of him. Edith leaned back in her
chair and regarded him with a twinkle in her
eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said, “I was. I stayed at Bellagio
ten years ago with my aunt and her
maid⁠--”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that’s all?” he asked, glaring at the
carpet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No--that’s not all,” said Edith in a low
voice. “It’s a long story, and I thought perhaps
I wouldn’t tell you; my aunt wanted me
to, but it was a very sad story, and it happened
so long ago I hoped people had forgotten;
although I might have known that people’s
memory for the unfortunate lasts as long as
their oblivion of the happier star. You have
observed to-night that I am a sensible woman,
Horace; what is your definition of a sensible
woman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, hang it all, I don’t know how to define
things, but I suppose I meant a woman
who wasn’t foolish--never made a fuss, or
scenes, or mistakes, or did--well, stupid things,
you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” said Edith, smiling demurely, “as
a girl I think I must have answered to your
description of a foolish woman, Horace. I
don’t know that I made scenes, but I certainly
did what people call foolish things, and I behaved,
as my aunt would no doubt tell you,
as an idiot; at the time you mention she called
me a suicidal idiot!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To begin with, I must tell you I am very
susceptible to beauty. I probably shouldn’t
have tolerated you nearly as well if it hadn’t
been for your extremely handsome nose--you
needn’t blush--it is handsome, and I know it
is through no effort of your own that you have
acquired this undoubted beauty. When I
reached Bellagio I saw there the most beautiful
human being I have ever seen in my life
(you need not jog your foot, Horace); she
was a woman, and she was exquisitely beautiful.
If you ask my aunt, she will tell you that
a girl as beautiful as that ought to be immured
for life behind walls. However, she wasn’t
immured, she was walking along on the shores
of the lake with a loathsome man I hated, and
she had a mouth that made your heart ache
to look at, with the mere maddening beauty of
it! She was very tall, and everything about her
was slender that ought to be slender--and every
curve that ought to be full was full--and her
head was poised like a flower, and her skin was
soft as the tenderest little petal of a new bud,
and colored like light through a cloud, and her
eyes were dark and stormy like a black lake
in the mountains--and unutterably sad. I
could go on describing her all night, but you’ve
got to go at half-past ten. The absurd part
of the whole story is that she was in love with
the silly little scrap one might call a man, I
suppose, if we had to label him as a specimen,
and he--was tired (if you please) of her!
Plainly, Helen of Troy, the Venus of Milo--or
whatever you choose to consider within a
thousand miles of her--no longer suited his
convenience!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At this moment he caught diphtheria, and I
sincerely hope he suffered abominably; but,
needless to say, he hadn’t the decency to die.
No one in the hotel was any the wiser. It
was too early in the season, and the man had
money, so ‘Helen of Troy’ nursed him in their
particular part of the hotel behind a carbolic
sheet, and we were told he had <span class='it'>bronchitis</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My aunt is one of the most plucky and altogether
delightful women I know, but she has
a pronounced terror of infectious disease, and
if she had guessed what lurked in that distant
wing I might never be telling you this
story. One morning as I was crossing the
hotel lounge I saw the unpromising specimen
of manhood in front of the bureau. He had
quite recovered and was giving notice for his
departure that day. He added that Madame
could not accompany him; she had better be
removed to the hospital, as he was unable to
continue to offer her his protection. I heard
him say this in the quick French, which he no
doubt calculated could hardly reach the intelligence
of an English miss. Then I went
over to the bureau and told the manager that I
would be responsible for Madame, and that I
would nurse her and undertake her expenses.
He seemed very unwilling to accept my offer,
and finally under promise of secrecy he told me
the nature of the trouble. There was no one in
the hotel but ourselves. I told my aunt what
I intended to do, and that as bronchitis was
occasionally infectious I should not come out
of my patient’s room for some weeks. (Did
I ever tell you that I had worked previously
in a London hospital for a year? I meant to
be a nurse, but my throat wasn’t strong
enough, so I never finished my training.)
Well, my aunt appealed to my common sense,
to my affection for her, and finally to her
authority; and then I kissed her and reminded
her that she had always told me to consider
my life my personal property, and how long
Helen of Troy’s eyelashes were, and what an
ineffable brute the man must have been. She
said I was a suicidal idiot, and that I could
send her a daily message. But of course I
never did, because you might be able to carry
that kind of bronchitis in notes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, the end of the story was that my aunt
met the doctor, and whether she had had her
suspicions or not before, I don’t know, but the
doctor couldn’t stand against her; she got the
truth out of him, left the hotel in a panic, and
wired to me to leave instantly, get quarantined
somewhere, and then join her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had been by this time a fortnight with
Helen of Troy; she was recovering, but she
had found out that I wasn’t the man, and her
heart was broken. I don’t expect you know
anything about women with broken hearts,
Horace, but I think you would agree with me,
you can’t leave them. So I didn’t leave
Helen of Troy. We stayed on together long
after she had actually recovered. I slept in a
room leading out of hers, and I was glad I
was a strong woman, because on three occasions
she tried to commit suicide, and you need
a good deal of muscle to stop a person who
wants to commit suicide as much as she did.
After her illness was over we used to wander
up and down the garden by the lake-side. The
season had begun there, and all kinds of people
kept turning up. One day some strange
men spoke to us in the garden. One of them
was a friend of the ‘unpromising specimen,’
and before we had time to make ourselves perfectly
plain to them the hotel gossip scuttled
off like a rabbit from almost under our feet to
the manager, and he told us the next morning
very politely that unfortunately our rooms
were wanted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We left, of course, and Helen of Troy
went back to America (did I tell you she was
half-Jewish and half-American?). She had a
friend on the stage who had offered her a
part. She never told me her real name. I
always called her ‘Helen,’ and though she
promised to write to me I have never heard
from her since. I expect she thought I might
try to trace her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is the whole and entire story of
Helen of Troy, and I’m afraid, my dear
Horace, that you can no longer consider me
the most sensible woman in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Horace took her hand in his and kissed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I had married you ten years ago,”
he said gently. Then he remembered Annette.
He let her hand drop suddenly, and
walked quickly to the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s half-past ten,” said Edith, and then
she moved past him and ran hastily upstairs,
because she did not wish him to say good-night
to her while he was remembering Annette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Lestrange’s comment on the story was
characteristic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear me, Horace!” she said. “What an
extraordinary tale! How strange those kind
of people are! I suppose it never occurred to
either the aunt or the niece to hire a trained
nurse for the creature?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Horace hung his head, because there
are some explanations which the children of
light are ashamed to put to the children of this
world, who are so much wiser.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>V</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>M</span>iss Lestrange called the next
day upon her future sister-in-law.
She took a chair with the resigned manner
of a woman who will try to be as comfortable
as she can, and she talked to Edith with a detached
but patient cordiality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bayswater is such a charming part to live
in,” she began. “I felt as I came away from
stuffy little Curzon Street quite as if I were
on a picnic or a summer excursion. It must
be so nice to live here; I wonder why nobody
does?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith smiled pleasantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, ‘nobody’ does,” she replied, pouring
out tea; “and it’s only the ‘somebodies’ who
don’t! You see, Miss Lestrange, you must
pay the penalty of greatness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear me--witty!” thought Miss Lestrange,
and she used the word with as much
disapproval as if she meant “wild.” Aloud
she merely murmured something irrelevant
about Kensington Gardens. It was one of
Miss Lestrange’s great social gifts that she
could allow an awkward silence to take place
without any of the awkwardness adhering to
herself. She would sit staring through a tortoiseshell
<span class='it'>lorgnette</span> with an air which plainly
said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This silence is nothing to me; I can break
it whenever I choose--only I don’t choose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unfortunately, Edith had the tea-things,
which did almost as well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think the Lindleys knew your aunt,” said
Miss Lestrange at last. “It is so pleasant, is
it not, to discover a mutual acquaintance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very,” said Edith. “It’s almost as exciting
as making a new relation. Do you take
sugar?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One lump, please. I was delighted to hear
of my brother’s impending marriage,” continued
Miss Lestrange; “delighted. Of
course, I had been expecting it for some
time. I have but little faith in inveterate
bachelors, and none at all in inveterate widowers.
Besides, a sensible marriage for a man
of my brother’s age is very desirable. He settles
down, the phase of romance is over, and
the phase of domesticity sets in; and, of course,
it is always a relief when one knows for certain
that one’s brother won’t marry a barmaid.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t fancy Horace marrying a barmaid
at any time,” said Edith, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you are my age, my dear, you will
no doubt live to see, as I have seen, all the
things you cannot imagine taking place,” said
Miss Lestrange, putting down her tea, which
she had not finished, as if she did not like it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There had been things in their conversation
which had not pleased her, but this last hit had
told (if you go on hitting long enough, some
hit generally does). She had expected to
find Miss Walton good-looking and good-humored;
she had not expected to find her unembarrassed
and well-armed. However, Miss
Lestrange always dealt with the unexpected
as if it was perfectly ordinary, so that no one
ever discovered her mistakes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe you are to be introduced shortly
to your step-son!” Miss Lestrange began reflectively.
“I hope you will take to the poor
child.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I always love children,” said Edith gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” said Miss Lestrange, “that is a refreshing
change from the modern note.
Annette’s child, however--I refer to my
brother’s former wife--is peculiar. Annette
was highly sensitive, like a spring blossom, and
her son takes after her. I shall be delighted
to help you in any way I can upon the subject.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is coming at five o’clock; I hope very
much he won’t dislike me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear, why should he?” said Miss Lestrange,
rising to her feet and holding out her
hand. “He is not old enough to remember his
mother, fortunately--I mean, of course, there
will be no soreness of comparison as there
might be with an older child. We will meet
again soon, shall we not? Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith suddenly found that she could say
nothing more; a slow paralysis of icy cold
seemed to be numbing her limbs and brain.
She could find no more words; this woman--pleasant,
courteous, heartless--seemed to have
pelted her to death with innumerable hailstones.
She stood breathless and quivering in
the doorway, and there Lady Walton found
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear!” she said quickly. “What is
the matter?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith began to laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Horace’s sister is a very clever woman,
auntie,” she said. “Now, if I were a man I
would swear loud and long, and then go and
take a sherry cobbler or a gin sling, or whatever
is the strongest American drink, to give
me fresh courage to meet my small step-son,
for I believe she came just now simply to unnerve
me for the ordeal, for I have a feeling
as if there were worse to follow. She spoke
of Horace throughout as ‘my brother,’ in a
tone which gave me fully to understand that
he would always be far more extensively her
brother than my husband.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Walton looked at her carefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go and take a cup of tea,” she said; “your
nerves are shaken, but depend upon it, child,
you didn’t collapse when she was there. I
should have received her with you, only I did
not like her to think that you needed to call
up your reserves. Let us hope the men of the
family are less alpine. I shall be out till
dinner.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Walton kissed her niece; she was very
fond of her, rather sorry for her, and extremely
proud of her. On the whole she considered
Edith over-sensitive; she would have dearly
enjoyed a tussle with Miss Lestrange herself,
but Edith was too tender-hearted for prolonged
warfare. She could take the defensive,
but she couldn’t hit back. Lady Walton
knew this, and it annoyed her; in her heart of
hearts she was rather cruel, and she despised
people who could not be a little cruel too.
Still, Edith was undeniably plucky, so she
patted her cheek and went out cheerfully for
a drive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half an hour later, with eager palpitating
heart Edith gazed out of the window at a pair
of figures coming up the steps. Horace was
leading a small curly-headed boy, to whom he
was talking nervously in that tone of eager
and would-be cheerfulness in which parents
seek to ingratiate themselves in order to overcome
the inflexible judgment of a child.
Leslie said nothing; he was using enormous
self-control, but it did not reach to speech.
That morning his beloved tutor had been
spirited away--a whim of this new invisible
monster. Who knew how soon his Aunt Etta,
or even his father himself, would follow, and
he (Leslie) would be left without protection
or assistance, face to face with the unendurable?
His father’s words fell upon his ears
like the well-meaning patter of a nursery
rhyme. Talking made no difference; it could
not cover up the fact that they were going
to see Her, and that she lived--this crushing
monster of iniquity--in this very house whose
stiff and odious steps they were now climbing.
There were flower-boxes in the windows full
of pink geraniums. Leslie was very fond of
flower-boxes. He was an imaginative little
boy, and he said fiercely to himself:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are not really flower-boxes, they are
pretend boxes, put there like wicked witches
pretend to put things in fairy tales to take you
in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Horace cleared his throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You will try to be nice to her, won’t you,
my boy, for your old father’s sake?” he asked
as he rang the bell. This was a mistake; he
should have let Leslie ring the bell. Aunt
Etta always did. Leslie said so in a tone of
ruffled uneasiness. His father apologized but
repeated his question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes, I shall be polite!” said Leslie.
“Aunt Etta said Lestranges are always
polite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I hope you’ll be kind too,” said his
father. Leslie said nothing; he had not been
told that Lestranges are always kind--besides,
he was examining the carpet. It was nice and
thick, and he thought there were birds on it,
but they were not going slowly enough to make
sure. A door opened, and in a bower of late
spring flowers stood a woman--a tall, dark
woman with lips that laughed and eyes that
swam in tears, and outstretched hands and a
low, sweet voice like music--saying his name
very quickly and paying no attention to his
father at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leslie stopped perfectly still and looked at
her. There was no doubt about it, she was
worse than a witch--she was an enchantress!
He knew no spell to change her back into a
snake or a pig. He could only stand and look
at her with grave and disapproving eyes, and
then hold out his little slender hand with the
stately politeness of a well-mannered child--the
severest rebuke in Nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you do?” he said gravely; then he
looked round for his father. His father was
gone. For a moment he had a wild thought of
darting after him, of screaming for help and
flying down those soft, broad covered passages.
Horror shook his quivering nerves,
but pride restrained him. His father had deserted
him. Perhaps she had the power to
make his father invisible. At any rate, she
should not make a Lestrange a coward, so he
sat down politely and looked at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you will like these little cakes I
have got for your tea,” said Edith, and her
hand shook a little. “They are all in the shape
of fishes. I have a very nice cook, and she
made them for me, and we put eyes in--and
everything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was very kind of you,” said Leslie, “but
I would rather not eat them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you will have some tea, won’t you?”
she pleaded; “and all these buns have got hundreds
and thousands on them, and they are buttered.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no doubt about it, she knew how
to put things, this enchantress; the hundreds
and thousands were a distinct point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, I had my tea before I came,”
said Leslie. “I won’t take anything to eat--at
least I’d rather not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t want you to do anything you’d
rather not!” cried Edith quickly. “I want you
to be happy; don’t you think--don’t you think,
Leslie, we might be friends?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leslie eyed her fixedly. She had not
laughed at him, nor asked how old he was, nor
offered to kiss him; she had done nothing really
wrong, and there was something quite friendly
and shining in her eyes--probably magic--but
certainly shining.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think it’s possible,” said Leslie
slowly. Then he added politely:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we talk of something else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith went to the window. Her eyes did
not shine so much when she came back--perhaps
his courage and self-command were overcoming
the magic. It seemed like it, for her
voice was not so gay. To begin with, it had
sounded very gay, as if she would like to dance
and play games. This was probably what she
had done with father. She had bewitched him
completely. Mr. Flinders had said so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your father told me, Leslie,” said Edith
when she returned from the window, “that you
were very fond of soldiers. I, too, am very
fond of soldiers, so I thought perhaps you
would like to see some I bought this morning--they
are two cavalry regiments; both the
generals have cocked hats and swords.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are there guns?” asked Leslie with forgetful
rapture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, there are guns and gun-carriages.
Shall I clear this table? There, you know
how to fasten them on perhaps! Will you
show me how?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leslie regained his knowledge of the situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are very easy to put on,” he said.
“You run them along like this. Are they
imitation, or can they go off?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They can go off with peas,” said Edith
kindly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leslie’s face flushed--real guns that could
go off with peas were excellent and sane
amusements even for an enchantress. By-and-by
he forgot her profession, and began to
order her about. They played contentedly for
an hour, then the clock struck six. Leslie
counted it. “Shortly after six, my poor dear
boy, they will let you come home,” his Aunt
Etta had said. He put down the general and
pushed the table away; his lips quivered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re--you’re almost nice,” he said. “I
wonder you can break up a home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my dear, my dear!” cried Edith, but
she did not offer to touch him; she only turned
shining and appealing eyes to him. Her eyes
were too much; they should not have been so
kind when she was so wicked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall never see the soldiers again,” he
said mournfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Leslie, they are yours; I bought them
for you,” she pleaded “Indeed, indeed, I
bought them for you this morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lestranges don’t take bribes,” said Leslie
coldly; still he looked at the general and the
best gun--it was a very good gun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it isn’t a bribe,” explained the enchantress.
“Won’t you even take the general
and the gun⁠--”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leslie’s chest heaved. He looked across the
table at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you give up my father?” he asked.
“If you’ll give him up I’ll take--I’ll take
both the general and the gun.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but, Leslie, I couldn’t--he’d be so unhappy⁠--”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, he wouldn’t,” said Leslie firmly.
“He’d get used to it in time; there are lots
of things he has--me and Aunt Etta, and a
new cuckoo clock I gave him for his last birthday.
Oh, give him up--give him up--!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tears came suddenly now; all the controlled
terrors, the pent-up agony, the puzzled
situation, the fearful prospects, rushed to the
top of the child’s mind: it was like the over-filling
of a cup. He flung himself face downwards
on the sofa, dragging the tablecloth
after him and covering the carpet with defeated
soldiers. Edith knelt beside him trying
to soothe and comfort him, but his little
clenched hands pushed her away. The general
with his cocked hat and the best gun lay
on her lap, and bitter tears fell on them--bitter,
unavailing tears; and so Horace found
them shortly after six.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He carried his sobbing little boy away, and
Edith sat and wept over the soldiers alone and
uncomforted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder how she can have managed to
upset him so,” said Etta; “but I thought this
afternoon that she hardly looked as if she could
manage a delicate highly-strung child. She
has sent him into a really dangerous fit of crying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Horace, he went to his study and
smoked a strong cigar. He was puzzled and
disappointed. Edith had been so certain she
could win the little chap over, and the boy
hadn’t cried while he was there. Edith must
have done something stupid; she had been upset
enough herself, poor girl; but he did not
go back and comfort her--she must have done
something stupid.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VI</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'> “I</span>t all depends upon what you mean by a
successful marriage,” Lady Walton had
remarked earlier in the day. “You have now,
my dear Edith, been married ten years; you
look ten years younger than you are; your
husband spends all his evenings at home, and
you have an excellent staff of servants. I
really do not see what more you can ask!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t suppose we often see why other
people should ask more than they have,” Edith
replied. “Other people ought to be satisfied,
and yet other people aren’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t wish to talk metaphysics,” said
Lady Walton; “it reminds me of the time when
I fell downstairs on the back of my head and
had concussion of the brain. I suppose you
mean you haven’t any children? Neither
had I, and I have never regretted it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Walton was one of those people who
always thought that what she did not object to
was not objectionable; she felt this very
strongly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My own faults, which I can excuse quite
easily and always see reasons for,” she went on
after a pause, “would annoy me excessively
in a younger generation--even my virtues
would seem weak and tame imitation in some
pudding-faced young girl. I should have
known better what to do with a boy who would
have been certain to die if he had been satisfactory,
and equally certain to live if he was
not. No, my dear Edith, let us be thankful
we have both been spared a tiresome and difficult
vocation. An unhappy marriage is often
made bearable by such additions, but a really
happy marriage can dispense with them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, a really happy marriage!” Edith had
murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” her aunt had replied briskly,
“you are one of those unfortunate people who
ask too much, and do not take steps to get
it. You should do one or the other. What
your husband needs is something to shake him.
It is a pity you are not a delicate woman; you
might try nerves. I suppose you are too high
and mighty to stoop to flirtation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should do it so badly,” said Edith, laughing,
“and besides I’m forty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have such a tiresome habit of remembering
your own age,” her aunt replied; “it
even makes me remember mine. I will take a
nap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith had left her and gone home. It was
something, she reflected, to have a home, and--every
one would have agreed--such a comfortable
home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had had a difficult life these past ten
years; she had not only to make her husband
happy which had been her unswerving purpose
from the first, but she had had to watch her
failure, and accept the lower level of opportunity
allowed to her--and make him contented;
she had, at least, done this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Lestrange had taken Leslie slowly and
vaguely away; there was still a talk of his return
home--there would always be a talk of
it. Meanwhile the boy, his aunt, and an excellent
tutor (almost as amenable as Mr. Flinders)
divided their time between Mallows and
Brighton. The boy had been definitely delicate;
a determined effort to send him to Harrow
failed, and he was taken away once more
by his aunt and tutor. Oxford remained; he
was now quite strong enough for Oxford.
Still Miss Lestrange held him back; she could
not follow him to Oxford.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From time to time he visited his father.
The tie between them had never ceased to be
strong; but for Edith there had never been
a second chance. The boy was beautiful as
his mother had been, and suspicious with
all the hard, cramping suspicion of a weak
nature. Edith’s unvarying sweetness and
companionableness roused a sharp antagonism
in him; she was “trying to get round him,”
as his aunt had said. He fought Edith because
he could so easily have loved her; he
pushed her away from him because he wanted
to confide in her. He treated her with a
studied polite insolence which made her dumb
before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Horace Lestrange looked from one to the
other wistfully; something was wrong. Etta
said it was Edith’s fault, and Edith said nothing,
and the boy said nothing; so it ended in
Horace saying nothing too. He merely went
down by himself for week-ends to Mallows,
and felt that his marriage had been, not a
failure exactly, but not very definitely a
success.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had indeed frequently felt tenderness
for his wife, and he always felt friendship.
She was his most delightful fireside and holiday
companion; they read the same books,
laughed at the same things; but they hardly
lived the same life. He missed his boy with
a kind of dull ache that would have been
difficult to fathom; and if it wasn’t Edith’s
fault--well--it wouldn’t have happened if it
hadn’t been for her. Edith stood with her
hand on the mantelpiece gazing into the study
fire; on one side of it sat her husband, glancing
through the evening paper; and, on the
other, the boy on one of his occasional visits
(lately they had been much more frequent)
to his London home. He was half-smoking
cigarette after cigarette, and as Edith turned
her attention to him she was struck afresh by
the expression in his eyes. It was the tyrannical
selfish face of a pleasure-seeker. She compared
it, with a sharp pang of disappointment,
to the controlled, honest manliness of her
husband’s expression. Couldn’t they have
made his boy more like him--have put something
better than hungry discontent into
Leslie’s beautiful eyes?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m going out,” said the boy suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father looked up from his paper with
evident disappointment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought Esdaile was coming in for
bridge?” he said quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think, if you will excuse me, I’ll go out,”
his son repeated, with a politeness which did
not conceal his evident intention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father eyed him curiously for a moment,
then he said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Musical comedy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy flushed scarlet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you wish to know where I am going,
sir?” he asked with angry irony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith interposed quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you are going, Leslie,” she said, “would
you mind telephoning for me, to Esdaile, not
to come? It’s no use his coming if we aren’t
going to play bridge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leslie never willingly looked at Edith; he
did not do so now. He merely raised his eyebrows,
because he was annoyed at being asked
to do anything for anybody else, and replied:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most certainly, if you wish it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His father returned to the newspaper; the
boy stalked in a turmoil of offence and pricked
conscience out of the room. If you want to
be very angry, people who attempt to meet you
with patience and kindness are mere fuel for
the flame. Leslie had broken up a bridge
four; he was going to do something wrong;
and nobody told him not to, or attempted to
interfere with him in any way. It was all extremely
tiresome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The two left together exchanged a long look
of sympathy and understanding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s very young,” said Edith softly.
“That’s all, Horace--only very young.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s confoundedly cool,” said his father
gloomily, “spoiling a bridge four like that, and
got up specially because he said he wanted it!
It’s so deuced difficult to know what the fellow
does want nowadays.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What made him blush like that, Horace,
when you said ‘musical comedy’?” said his wife,
sitting opposite him, and holding up a fire-screen
between her face and the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s some nonsense Etta’s been writing
me; she thinks he comes up here to meet a
woman. No doubt he’s got some queer boy
adoration in his head, but it can’t be anything
serious at his age.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it a--what kind of a woman?” asked his
wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, some wonderful American beauty, old
enough to be his mother--the star of some
touring company. It seems she has turned
the heads of all the London youths together.
I told Etta she’d far better leave the matter
alone. It isn’t as if the boy’s prospects were
dazzling; he’ll have plenty, of course, in time,
but he’s got nothing now but his mother’s
money, and this person isn’t likely to marry
him for five hundred a year. In three years’
time, well--he’ll have forgotten her name.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But--but her influence mightn’t be good?”
Edith persisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know,” said Horace reflectively.
“Some of her type are quite unscrupulous, no
doubt, but not all of them. Anyhow, I did do
something; I sent her a note, just giving the
facts of the boy’s expectations quite plainly,
and asking her what she meant to do about it.
I might have called to see her--Etta wanted
me to--but I didn’t see the good. Musical
comedy ladies are not in my line.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you didn’t tell me, Horace?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith lifted the fire-screen a little; he could
not see her face; in her voice there was a touch
of reproach, not more--the friendly reproach
of a comrade who has been left out of a consultation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I don’t know why I told you now,
but it seemed natural somehow when you
asked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad it seemed natural,” said Edith
quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In most married lives there is one who understands,
and one who is content to be understood.
Edith read her husband’s mind as if it
were a well-known book. She knew his motives,
his honest scruples, his studious chivalry,
his quiet reticence. She knew when he suffered
because the marks of it were on her own
heart; she knew when he was contented,
puzzled, worried, or pleased; and he knew
nothing whatever about her, except that she
was always sweet to him, and only occasionally
(as we are told all women are) unreasonable.
That he was sitting opposite a woman now
whose heart was very nearly broken, who had
fed in secret on sharp misery and long, ineffectual
pain, had never even dimly touched
his imagination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lady Walton had supposed that Edith
might have a difficult time, but that the quiet
routine of married life would soon stifle the
unnatural hunger of her heart. Nothing had
been stifled except expression. Edith had
thrust her own pain out of sight with strong
hands; she had shut love and anguish out of
her eyes--she had schooled her lips not to
quiver and held her voice steady against the
invasions of emotion; she had taken stones for
bread, and received them with pleased acquiescence,
as if, after all, her preference had always
been for stones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when it came to Horace’s pain, to the
unstilled longing of his heart, which she could
have stilled; to the silent, patient endurance,
which she could have stirred into something resembling
passionate joy; then her life rose up
against her, and the bitter waters of intense
and heavy anguish passed over her soul. Ah,
the sickening pressure of those hours! While
he lay beside her sleeping quietly, she clenched
her hands, and quivered with the sobs she dared
not free. And then with haggard eyes she
watched the slow day dawn over London,
the day which would be--as all other days to
her--the resetting of her life to sober pain.
He thought her a sensible, level-headed, unemotional
woman, and she was a creature born
of flame and tears!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The hand that held the fire-screen shook a
little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mustn’t let yourself worry about it,”
said Horace kindly, “or I shall be sorry I’ve
told you. Honestly, I don’t think it will become
a serious matter. There’s the evening
post. I rather imagine that extremely fancy
envelope may be from the lady herself. My
correspondents are usually less stimulating in
their notepaper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He read it, frowned in a puzzled way, and
tossed it over to Edith. It ran:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>My Dear Sir</span>,--Thank you for your simple, explicit
statement of the case. You gave me a great deal of
amusement, and no pain. I wish your son had copied
your style. I daresay he has told you that he meant to
marry me; but though an imaginative child, I don’t
suppose he can ever have said to you that I meant to
marry him. I don’t make promises, and unless any unforeseen
circumstance should arise, I am not likely to
undertake the experiment. As to my moral influence
(which I notice you have done me the honor not to
mention), I have always made it my invariable rule to
leave boys alone. I laugh at them, but I do not hurt
them.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:6em;margin-top:0.5em;'>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:0em;margin-top:0.5em;'><span class='sc'>Anastasia Falaise</span>.</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what do you make of that, my dear?”
said Horace Lestrange, feeling after his
matches. “Seems to let us out, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith let the paper fall into her lap and
looked into the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor woman!” she said very gently. “Do
you know, Horace, she reminds me just a
little of Helen of Troy. Helen used to talk
like that, as if the soul had been eaten out of
her words. I think a woman must be very unhappy
to write like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is time you went to bed, Edith; you look
tired,” said her husband. “Just throw that letter
on the fire, will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She threw the letter on to the fire and
watched it burn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor woman!” she whispered to herself
again. “Poor woman!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Horace got up and opened the door for her.
He was very much relieved, but he felt a pang
of compunction at the same time. He had
been a fool to tell Edith; it seemed to upset
her; the facts of life--love’s tragedies--ought
to be kept from good women. Then he went
back to his paper.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VII</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>L</span>ike many people who believe in an over-ruling
Providence, Miss Lestrange never
left anything to it. On the contrary, when her
plans succeeded, she remarked triumphantly
that it was the will of heaven; and when they
failed, she said nothing about it, and tried
again. It is usually supposed that plans which
play the part of Providence fail very easily, but
this is not really so; it is only the result of the
plan that fails--carefully combined arrangements
made with due knowledge of the forces
of life seldom fail. What fails is what we expected
to win from such combinations. You
plant, water, and gain your increase, and what
you thought were the golden apples of the
Hesperides taste like dust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is what happened to Miss Lestrange.
She gave a whole-hearted devotion to Leslie;
she kept him away from what she honestly believed
to be adverse influences; she cared for
the delicate little boy until he became as strong
as the average youth; she made her home his
home; people always referred to him as “your
dear boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the palace of her dreams, but the
monarch had abdicated, and the palace without
its King is a Court in mourning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leslie was vaguely dissatisfied; he had worshiped
his Aunt Etta with an ignorant devotion
all his life; he had given her the love of a
child and the warm-hearted loyalty of a boy.
Now he was grown up. He was nineteen, and
he would probably never be quite as old again--in
any case, he would never feel such unbroken
confidence in his own judgment--and
what did his aunt appear? A small, faded,
old-fashioned woman, who said “No” to his
wishes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is a time in every boy’s life when he
looks very narrowly at his own parents; very
often they are the barriers at the gates of his
imaginary Paradise, and he regards them as
barriers; but if there is solid stuff in the youth,
the tie is strong enough to hold. His parents
are, of course, wrong, their opinions are worthless,
their ideas are effete and purely mirth-inspiring.
But they are his parents. They are
people who love him with a strange love; they
are ignorant people, but he forgives them, and
one day discovers that he himself belongs to
this inferior branch of humanity, and is giving
his life up for his sons, who regard him in his
turn with affectionate depreciation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leslie loved his father with a deep natural
love, which time turned into an irritated need.
He had come to the conclusion that women
were all very well, but that feminine relations
were a jealous bore, and that--you must see
life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So he saw life. Saw it immaturely and unwisely--or
rather he may have been said not to
see it, but with the rush of youth’s music in his
ears he ran blindfold, and Life mocked him to
her heart’s content, and gave him pebbles for
diamonds and dross for gold, till she blunted
alike his discrimination and his growth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Lestrange stood by watching him with
incompetent agony. She had seen these things
happen before to other people’s boys, and she
had always known why. The mothers were
silly, the boys were unlicked cubs--they had
been spoilt from the first. Now she was not
quite so sure. Perhaps such things happened
just out of misfortune, unhappiness, blunders
that must come, accidents of the type which are
said to haunt families who live according to the
best regulations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lines came into Miss Lestrange’s placid
face, she lost sleep, appetite, and repose. She
woke with vague terrors, she was haunted by
impotent fears. There was nothing to be
done, and she hadn’t the strength to do nothing.
Finally, the whole story focused on one
notorious lady of musical comedy. The youth
of London gave her desperate homage and adoration;
she was old enough to be their mother;
but they did not keep these gifts for their
mothers, they gave them to Anastasia Falaise,
and she accepted them with easy laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Lestrange wrote to her brother, and her
brother replied heartlessly that it was “all
right.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leslie went on worshipping at this popular
shrine; he was continually absent from Mallows;
if he was present he was silent when he
wasn’t irritable. He never mentioned the
lady’s name, but he wrote to her every day; she
wrote to him sometimes, and vague ideas, resisted
by common sense, prompted Miss Lestrange
to tamper with their correspondence.
This correspondence flourished even more conspicuously
after the ineffective efforts of Leslie’s
father. It was evident to Miss Lestrange
that there was no help to be met in that quarter,
so she attacked the citadel itself. With nervous
incoherence she implored Leslie to come
abroad, to give up this absurd infatuation.
Leslie raised youth’s deadly standard of
silence. He blocked her utterance with a
gloomy stare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, he observed that he did not know
what she meant, and left the room. Young
men and even old ones are to be congratulated
on this gift of absence; it is a very effective
weapon. Leslie did not return for some time;
when he did, Miss Lestrange said nothing further
on the subject, for she had stayed in the
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, goaded to desperation, she committed
an unprecedented error. She may, indeed,
have been described as completely losing
her head. She went to call one day by appointment
on Anastasia Falaise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anastasia was staying in a famous London
hotel. She had a charming sitting-room; it
was littered with presentations, and she sat
shaded by pink blinds with easy indolence in a
large armchair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Lestrange’s first impression may be
given as it flashed into her mind, “No woman
of that type has any right to be so beautiful.”
Anastasia showed neither youth nor years in
her face; she might as easily have been thirty
as fifty; she had no lines about her eyes and
mouth or marring her low Greek forehead.
Her wide-set dark eyes looked like some perennial
mysterious spring of life. Her face
and neck and hands were the color of warm
ivory; her black hair was natural, but as nobody
believed it, she would sometimes--to confirm
it--let coil after coil fall to her knees. She
had beauty as some men have genius, and she
used it with more shrewdness and common
sense than this other gift is often used. She
had no particular wish to please Miss Lestrange,
so she simply stared at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Lestrange was vaguely uncomfortable;
she felt that she was with an extraordinary person,
and that she had lowered herself to the
same level by doing an extraordinary thing.
This was the kind of woman she knew how to
snub; she did not know how to appeal to her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you know my nephew, Leslie Lestrange,”
she began, blushing a little at her
companion’s insolent, inanimate beauty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are half-a-dozen photographs of him,
and the contents of several jewelers’ shops, I
should fancy, just behind you,” observed Anastasia.
“Have you come to retrieve them?
I told him that unless his people were whole-sale
jewelers he had better try a less expensive
amusement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His family is one of the oldest in England,”
said Miss Lestrange impressively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he’s young enough,” observed the
imperturbable beauty. She had a slight
American intonation which Miss Lestrange
found strangely aggravating; it annoyed her
almost beyond the power of speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have always taken the greatest interest in
my nephew’s concerns,” she continued. “I
have brought him up from his babyhood. I
stand to him in the place of his parents.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet I had a very sensible letter from
his father the other day,” interrupted Anastasia,
and she laughed a low velvety laugh
of pure pleasure (which Miss Lestrange
promptly mistook for vulgar impertinence).
“I think it is the most sensible letter I ever
had, and I answered it. I guess he hasn’t
sent you here, has he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My brother married regrettably a second
time,” said Miss Lestrange coldly, “a woman
of no family connections, singularly unsuited
to bring up a delicate and sensitive child; even
her husband has never pressed the point.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t say,” observed Anastasia, narrowly
regarding her exquisite fingers. “Poor
disconnected lady, I feel quite sorry for her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“On the contrary,” replied Miss Lestrange,
“she has, I think, been very fortunate; a marriage
of that kind for a girl in Edith Walton’s
position, and at her age--she was thirty at the
time--does not happen every day over here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anastasia suddenly woke up for the first
time; she opened her great eyes wide and
looked at Miss Lestrange. It was a look so
vital, so amazingly keen, staring out of the
soft, mysterious, velvety dullness, that Miss
Lestrange jumped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Anastasia sank back into her usual
attitude of inspired indolence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you say her name was?” she
asked languidly. “Haddlestone? I knew
some people called that once--way out West.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Walton,” repeated Miss Lestrange
distinctly; “but it really hardly matters what
her name is, I think, to the subject under discussion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were you discussing anything?” Anastasia
asked calmly. “I wasn’t. I am merely wasting
my time. However, I won’t waste any
more of it. What do you want?” and her
voice suddenly turned brisk and business-like.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want you,” said Miss Lestrange with a
sudden quiver of pathetic middle-aged passion,
“to let my boy go. You are a beautiful
woman; what does one boy more or less matter
to you--a practically penniless boy, too?
Send him about his business, like a--like a
kind-hearted woman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know I am a kind-hearted
woman?” Anastasia asked curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because,” said Miss Lestrange, rising to
her feet, “you have all the advantages on your
side; you can easily afford to be.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I do call that cute!” drawled Anastasia.
“That’s the best thing you’ve said yet,
only it’s not true. However, we needn’t go
into that. Now, Miss Lestrange, you’ve
made a great mistake; if you had left the matter
in your brother’s hands you’d never have
heard of it again--that is to say, you wouldn’t
seriously have heard of it. But, somehow or
other, you’ve put an idea into my head; well,
that was a mistake. I have very few ideas, and
I always act upon them. I’m going to act
right now; but I don’t want an audience--so,
good-by!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anastasia rose too. She was head and
shoulders above her companion, and Miss Lestrange
drew a long breath at the sight of her
majestic swaying figure. This was a woman
to wreck kingdoms, and why should she bother
her head about a boy--a boy like Leslie, whose
connections she didn’t even know, whose disabilities
she must, of course, see? It was all
very odd. The two women looked at each
other for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t understand you,” said Miss Lestrange
at last, a little helplessly, “and I don’t
see that I can offer you anything you want in
exchange for what I ask.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t,” said Anastasia; “nobody can
offer me what I want except chocolates. Fortunately,
I’m still very fond of chocolates.
Well, good-by, Miss Lestrange; I’m sorry I
can’t oblige you, but I’ve got to be amused,
and I am going to amuse myself with your
nephew.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, amuse yourself as much as you like,”
murmured Miss Lestrange, holding out her
hand in farewell, “but don’t marry him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I guess you’re going to be disappointed,”
observed Anastasia, as her companion, reaching
the door, turned to look back at her. “I
guess you’re going to feel disconnected, too!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Lestrange didn’t know what her
hostess meant, but she had said all she had to
say and done all she could do. There was
nothing more to act upon, and she knew that
she had failed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Miss Lestrange felt old and helpless;
something that had always accompanied
her--a sense of the inherent dignity and interest
of her position--which made her observe
the world blandly, as one who has a right to a
front seat on a grand-stand--left her. She
felt as if she was, after all, only one of the
crowd, liable to be pushed and jogged by elbows,
even liable to be thrust permanently
aside. She stood quite still in the finely upholstered
lounge of the big hotel, and a waiter
came up and asked her if he could bring her
anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Miss Lestrange, sitting down
at one of the many little tables scattered about.
“You may bring me a cup of tea. Perhaps,”
she said to herself, “that was what I wanted.
I have missed my tea.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>VIII</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>E</span>dith hardly turned her head to say
“Come in!” to the timid knock at her
door. She was sitting at her desk, doing accounts,
and puzzled as usual by her immaculate
predecessor’s example--an example which, “as
the most sensible of women,” she tried hard to
follow, but she was frequently overcome by the
invincible malice of pounds, shillings, and
pence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pause, however, that followed arrested
her attention, and she turned to meet the eyes
of her step-son with a thrill of astonishment.
He had never before voluntarily entered her
private boudoir, and there was an air about his
whole person which betokened the unusual,
though he suppressed what he could only consider
a weakness as well as he could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith saw in a moment that she must suppress
it too. “I’m so glad you have come,”
she said; “now you can do this horrid sum for
me. I am trying to balance my accounts, and
though I can see quite plainly what I’ve spent
and what I had to spend, they obstinately refuse
to have anything to do with each other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leslie looked over her shoulder; he was
pleased to point out her mistake--it was a
very obvious one--and it at once put him at his
ease. He felt there could be nothing very
formidable in a woman who could make such a
silly mistake in quite a simple sum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat down beside her, smiling and looking
so utterly unlike the glum, discontented youth
she was accustomed to see that Edith could
barely conceal her astonishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got an awful lot to say to you,” he
volunteered at last. “What a jolly little room
you have here--just the kind of things I like!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you must come and like them a little
oftener,” said his step-mother with a friendly
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He glanced at her uneasily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect I must seem an awful ass to you,”
he remarked with sudden candor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear no,” she said, “nor am I a very terrible
person either, when you come to know
me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you,” said the boy, flushing scarlet--“you’re
ripping! I can’t think why I’ve
never noticed it before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith concealed a smile at this belated tribute;
she wondered what he was going to notice
next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you mind,” he began anxiously--“are
you quite sure you wouldn’t mind, if I
came here regularly--in between terms at Oxford,
I mean--instead of going to Mallows?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith gasped. Then she said very gently
and gravely:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear Leslie, this is your home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He got up and walked about; she hadn’t
used her advantage over him; she hadn’t even
made him look a fool. He was almost willing
to acknowledge that he was one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I’d like to tell you all about it,”
he began, “if you’re sure I sha’n’t bore you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, you won’t bore me,” said his companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I daresay you know--I daresay you may
have heard some talk about--about Anastasia
Falaise? Of course, you don’t know what
she’s like; people talk such confounded rot
about her, especially women. You should
hear Aunt Etta. They say she’s old; of
course, it’s all jealousy. She may be twenty-five--that’s
older than me, of course--I’m not
quite twenty,” (his nineteenth birthday had
taken place a week previously), “but then
what’s five years?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His step-mother was not prepared to say off-hand
what five years were; they might be such
different things; so she looked at the boy sympathetically
and shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“People talk such beastly stuff about age,”
the youth continued fiercely, “and not knowing
your own mind; why, of course, I know she’s
perfect. Why, Edith--Cleopatra, and Mary
Queen of Scots, and Helen of Troy--they
couldn’t have been anything to Anastasia--she’s--she’s--well,
the poets are all really
idiots; none of them describe her decently!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith looked as if she quite believed this; in
her heart of hearts she thought that the poets
had under-estimated Horace, but that was very
probably because they were, generally speaking,
men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know, I can’t believe in my luck,
Edith--I can’t really; she might have married
princes, and she’s fond of me,” cried the boy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith’s eyes filled with sudden tears. The
boy was very beautiful, young, exquisitely
shaped, with light curls and bright brown eyes,
and for the first time she was seeing his face
alive and eager with the joy of life!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can quite believe it, Leslie,” she said
gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And she’s promised to marry me,” he exclaimed
exultantly, “in three years’ time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His step-mother jumped. This was not
what she had been prepared to hear. It came
with a sudden shock. Horace had said the
woman was old enough to be the boy’s mother,
and Horace was certain to be right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Leslie!” she murmured, holding out
her hands, vaguely troubled and distressed.
“Oh, Leslie!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s all right,” said the boy, rising,
“you’ll like her, I know; and, fancy, Aunt
Etta--well--I can hardly believe it; she tried
to come between us, and actually went and
asked Anastasia to give me up. All my life
she’s tried to keep me away from dad and you--and
now--now Anastasia! I can’t forgive
her,” said Leslie, “and I shouldn’t think you
would.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took one of Edith’s hands and kissed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my dear boy,” she whispered, “you
don’t know, you don’t understand how she
loved you! You see you did make a mistake,
didn’t you? Just a little one that didn’t matter
really about me; don’t make another which
may matter terribly about your Aunt Etta.
Ah, Leslie, she’s given up her life for you--she
meant it all for the best. You see she--she
loves you. Try to forgive her!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d have forgiven her if she’d told me,”
said the boy, “but she did it on the sly. Father
did it, too--he wrote some stupid letter; but
then he told me he was going to--he didn’t
deceive me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy choked suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know,” he said, “I sometimes think
you and dad have been most awfully kind to
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith’s quivering lips smiled, and her eyes
shone as they had done ten years ago through
happy tears as she stood to welcome Horace’s
little son.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Leslie, Leslie!” she murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was not a demonstrative young man, so
he kicked at a footstool, and gave rather a
foolish laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, it’ll all be different now,” he said.
“Anastasia is most awfully keen on my being
nice to you and dad. She slanged me fearfully
for not living at home--pitched into me right
and left.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did she?” said Edith thoughtfully. “I
wonder why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, she’s so awfully clever and generous,
you know.” The boy went on: “She said she
was sure I’d been misunderstanding you all
along, and that the least I could do was to
make it up to you now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith suddenly rose to her feet, then she sat
down again, but her hands trembled, and there
was a look of surprise in her eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you,” she asked, “a picture of her to
show me, Leslie?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy laughed shamefacedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have her miniature,” he said; he drew out
a little velvet case and tossed it with a pretence
of indifference into Edith’s lap. She held it
for a moment as if she dreaded what might
meet her eye, and then, opening it quickly, she
gazed at the exquisite familiar face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Leslie,” she cried, “it <span class='it'>is</span> Helen of
Troy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boy was delighted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, she’s the most beautiful woman in
the world to me,” he said. “I’m glad you
like it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His step-mother sat staring as if spellbound
at the little velvet case; the boy took it from
her unresisting hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you feel like this about her, Edith,” he
said, “will you say something to my father for
me--something, I mean, about her being everything
she ought to be, you know, and it not
mattering her being a little older than me--and
really twenty-five is not very old, is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am forty,” said Edith irrelevantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Leslie looked up compassionately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” he said reassuringly, “you aren’t
really old yet, you know, Edith.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, I’m not really old yet,” agreed his
step-mother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Helen of Troy was forty-two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A long silence followed. The boy began to
fidget: he thought he would go and choose some
flowers for Anastasia. He looked hesitatingly
at Edith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Promise you’ll do your best for me?” he
asked, leaning over her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith raised her eves to his; they were
strangely sad and tender.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Leslie,” she said. “I promise you
that I will do my best for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kissed her and went out of the room.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>IX</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>A</span>nastasia was dressed to go out in the
Park. It was an exquisite day of early
spring. Winter had lingered longer than
usual and the green world had been for some
time pining and cheerless, an unfilled canvas
waiting for its artist--the sun. The park was
a shimmering sea of verdant new-born foliage
and young spring flowers. Crocuses and
daffodils and hyacinths made summer in the
midst of London.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everybody who was anybody wandered or
drove or motored in its precincts, or sat on the
green chairs under the trees and looked at each
other’s clothes, and speculated why So-and-so
was--or was not--with somebody else; and
somehow or other spring struck a note of freshness
into even the stalest speculations, and did
its best to prick the heart towards beauty and
delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anastasia was dressed to join the distinguished
throng. It was her world, and she
knew that she would be followed by whispers,
criticisms, and speculation, even as she would
be joined by groups of privileged young men,
very good-looking, well-dressed, ardent, and
most terribly silly--and she knew that none of
this would amuse her very much, and yet that
if it failed her, and when it failed her, there
would be nothing else. She was dressed in
white and orange, and as she looked at the
superb curves of her figure, at the classical
white face and wide dark eyes, at the huge coils
of her magnificent black hair, she smiled a
little. “Keats to-day,” she said to herself, “ye
ardent marigolds!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she turned round and faced Edith
Lestrange.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I came up unannounced,” said Edith. “I
said you expected me. I don’t know whether
you did. Oh, Helen--Helen; it’s you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Helen of Troy stood quite still, her arms
dropped to her sides, and as she stood there a
change came over her face; it was the same face,
and yet the years came out in it--the suppressed,
ignored, and baffled years; she could
no more have passed--even with gullible youth--for
twenty-five.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith came forward, her hands outstretched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Helen,” she said with a quiver in her
voice, “am I so old you don’t remember me--twenty
years ago?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t!” said Helen of Troy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She moistened her lips and put her hands up
to her throat, then suddenly she began to laugh
at first, just her old velvety laugh of music, and
then suddenly distorted, bitter laughter--terrible
to listen to--like harmony run mad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I remember you!” she cried between
the gusts of her laughter. “I remember you
all right, Edith.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith came forward quietly; her face was
very white and her eyes looked drawn and tired,
but she drew the orange and white figure shaking
with its bitter laughter to the sofa and sat
down beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know--I know,” she whispered gently;
“don’t laugh so, Helen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s all so funny,” laughed Helen of Troy,
“so ghastly, ridiculously, agonizingly funny,
and he might be your own son or mine, my dear--only
we haven’t any!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We haven’t any,” repeated Edith. “Now,
Helen, give me your hand. See, it’s very cold--and
now your other hand! The years have
made no difference--nothing has made any difference.
You should have come to see me.
When did you first know I was his step-mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Helen had found her self-control again; she
leaned back on the sofa-cushion with yielded
hands and half-shut eyes, gazing at her companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, not till Miss Lestrange came. I
wasn’t going to marry him, or give him another
thought, you know; I was going to laugh
him off gently, and then she let out suddenly
about you--and I saw!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you see?” asked Edith almost
sternly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw your life,” said Helen of Troy, opening
her eyes and fixing them on her companion’s
face. “I saw your life, Edith, and I
see it now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t think you do,” said Edith calmly,
“because you have not acted as if you did. Do
you suppose I want to wreck the boy’s career?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’ll wreck his own career,” said Helen
scornfully. “One rock or another, or else
some one must wrap him in cotton-wool. He’s
a spoilt peach--just that soft, little rotten spot
a woman sees at once. <span class='it'>I</span> don’t feel guilty.
Of course, I saw what the she-cat had done--cut
him adrift from you, and made your marriage
a divided thing. I remembered everything
you thought about love and marriage,
and I guessed quickly enough you’d had your
heart caught between two stones, and were
having it crushed out of you. I thought if I
used the boy he’d heal it all in three years.
You only wanted your little chance, my dear,
to make him love you from the bottom of his
shallow little soul, and if your husband saw
that, why, I suppose, even he would be convinced
that things weren’t your fault.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know he thinks things are my
fault now?” asked Edith quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you ever known a man who didn’t
hold the woman who loves him personally responsible
for all the rubs of life?” asked Helen
dryly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith did not answer--she smiled a little.
After a moment’s pause she said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re my friend, Helen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t speak as if I had dozens,” said Helen.
“I’ve only had one, and I don’t forget.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you’ll laugh him away very gently--so
gently that it won’t reach very far down?”
cried Edith.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There isn’t very far to reach,” replied Helen
irritably. “I don’t see why you always want
to be saving people pain; pain does good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does it?” asked Edith. Her eyes met
Helen of Troy’s; they looked a long time into
each other’s eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Helen at last, “it starves, it ages,
it embitters, it doesn’t do good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I’d rather have it done to me than
do it to other people,” said Edith. “It’s
rather more responsibility than I care to
undertake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I don’t know!” said Helen of Troy
with a reckless gesture; “it’s a game like any
other game. I wanted to pay back your score
for you. I knew <span class='it'>you’d</span> never do it. I kept
out of your way, I never let on, and I didn’t
suppose you’d find out for a day or two. I’m
going to-morrow. I thought the little fool
couldn’t tell you enough for you to work on,
the first time he had spoken to you for years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He showed me your miniature,” said Edith
gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Helen laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My face is my fortune,” she said grimly.
“Edith, I’ve made a lot of money!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, dear--yes,” said Edith; and she spoke
soothingly as you speak to a hurt child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve made a lot of money,” repeated Helen
of Troy. Then she looked away towards the
window and the swaying pots of flowers alive
in the sunshine. “And I’ve made nothing
else,” she said with a little bitter laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith did not speak, and the room seemed
filled with an unanswerable silence. Helen of
Troy got up at last and moved restlessly to
and fro.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I ought to be in the Park,” she said. “I’ve
made heaps of engagements. It doesn’t matter.
Why doesn’t your husband love you,
Edith?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my dear--my dear!” murmured Edith,
“don’t ask me that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But that’s just what I’m going to ask
you,” said Helen, coming to a stop in front of
her friend. “Don’t pretend--with your eyes!
Why, they were so sad when you came in, I
thought--I thought--the pain in them would
break everything in the room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My husband,” said Edith quietly, “is the
best man in the world.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As bad as that?” asked Helen, lifting her
eyebrows. “Why, my dear, you might as well
have married an institution or a reformatory
outright.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, not like that,” Edith said quickly;
“he’s a dear!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something can generally be done with a
dear,” said Helen reflectively, “even a good
dear. Edith, an idea has just occurred to me.
The chief difference between a bad man and a
good is that you know what a bad man wants
and you don’t know what a good man wants.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you always know what the man you
love wants, but you can’t always give it to him,”
she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me about it,” Helen demanded briefly.
And she sat down on the sofa again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s nothing to tell,” said Edith. “His
first wife died a year after their marriage, and
he is satisfied with that. He wants a sober,
matrimonial kind of tie, with no romance. I
have supplied more than he needed, but he does
not know it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you thought when you married
him⁠--”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t ask me what I thought,” cried
Edith passionately. “I dreamed--and the
people who dream get cast into pits. But all
this is beside the point, Helen. You’ve got
to give this boy up, you know--and do it so
that he will not blow his brains out, or make
some unprofitable spectacle of himself to Etta
and Horace. You haven’t said you would
yet, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never knew any one so fond of promises;
you ought to belong to a law court or a registry
or something,” said Helen impatiently.
“Why should I give the boy up? He is pretty
and pleases my fancy. I can assure you my
fancy is very particular; it’s a great thing to
get it pleased.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are going to do it because you want to
please me more,” said Edith imperturbably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you see, you stupid woman, that it’ll
settle your hash?” Helen broke in; “the boy’ll
find out somehow that you’re in it⁠--”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall tell him,” Edith interposed quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my Aunt Maria!” groaned Helen of
Troy, “my sainted Aunt Maria! You’ll tell
him? And what good do you suppose that’ll
do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not responsible for results,” said
Edith. “But I’ve got to tell him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m glad I know nothing of the obligations
of virtue,” said Helen. “I understand paying
for my fun, but I don’t see why you should pay
for other people’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t deceive Horace or the boy,” said
Edith, “to save myself. I don’t mind deceiving
people at all for any other reason. Half
of life is mutually tolerated deceit, but not for
purposes of self-protection; that I don’t like,
nor, my dear Helen, do you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Helen did not reply to this; she merely nibbled
her pen, which she had taken up from an
inlaid desk beside her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose you are going to bully me into
this thing?” she observed after a pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Dear me, yes,” said Edith, “that’s what
I’m here for!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Helen laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, then, my dear,” she said; “without
waiting to reflect on the wits of the Lestrange
family (and always excepting its head,
who had, I imagine, more than a suspicion of
the fact), allow me to remark that they should
have a goose for their coat-of-arms. I’ve
been married twice, and so far as I know the
second ceremony still holds good. For professional
purposes I do not lay much stress upon
my husband’s existence; privately, we prefer
our own lives to each other’s. I don’t need
any pity. I never cared for either of my husbands,
but I managed both beautifully. What
do you want me to say to your step-son now?
I may as well observe that in three years’ time
he would take it much better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you ought to tell him that you’re
forty-two,” she said at length.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Helen threw back her head and laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t twenty years ago,” she murmured.
“It’s ten minutes. Now, Edith, if you’ll take
my advice you’ll not decide this yourself.
You seem to have overlooked for the moment
the fact of your husband’s existence. Does he
know what happened twenty minutes--years
ago--I mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” said Edith; “I told him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well, then,” said Helen of Troy. “I
happen to know that Leslie is dining out to-night.
I will, therefore, invite myself to dinner
with you. Do you trust me, Edith?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a most unscrupulous woman,” said
Edith. “Still, you can’t do much harm with a
mere meal, so if you like we’ll risk it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Helen stooped towards her and kissed her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After all,” she said, “I’ve had something
out of my life. I’ve had this.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>X</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>H</span>orace was slightly surprised on coming
down dressed for dinner to meet in
his wife’s sitting-room a lady of such widely-spread
picture-postcard fame. He had already
seen Anastasia twice in the musical comedy
which she had made famous, but his wife’s
introduction arrested him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Horace,” she said, “this is Helen of Troy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment he was baffled by memory,
and then suddenly the old sacrifice of the impetuous
girl who was now his strangely sensible
wife came back to him. He held out his
hand at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am most happy to meet Helen of Troy,”
he said, smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no one at dinner, and the house-hold
dignity, the little vivid picture of delicate
repose lived long in Anastasia’s memory.
Horace was an excellent host, and Edith was
a loadstone for other people’s minds. She
drew out their best with a silent magnetic skill,
hardly participating so much as forming an
atmosphere in which it was very pleasant and
easy to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I always could say anything to Edith,” observed
Anastasia to her host, “but I had quite
supposed that I should have to talk to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Horace laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re so simple and dull,” he said. “We
are like an old tune to a practised singer; we
give her an easy swing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you’re not dull,” said Anastasia; “it’s
rather an art to be as simple as all this, and
I’ve never met it in my own people. We’re
smart, we’re clever, we’re attractive, we’re
the most charming people in the world, but
we’re not simple.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You can’t expect a young nation to have
the quality of an old shoe,” said Horace.
“English people have done the same things for
a very long time. They stand on the basis of
habit. Now all the Americans I ever met
wanted to be individual, personal, impressive--and
they very often were. When they were
not, it was rather a strain to listen to them; but
we don’t want, as a rule, to be like that; it
amuses us to have people do it for us; but I expect
that in our heart of hearts we don’t think
it very solid. There’s something in finding
such an easy old track, and knowing that
among your own class you’ll find the same talk,
the same purpose, the same <span class='it'>genre</span>. I’m not
sure it isn’t good for conversation as well, because
it makes you less self-conscious. You
start with so much that can be taken for
granted.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Helen gave him a good deal of attention;
she was thinking the man out; he wasn’t in the
least like his son, nor had she expected him to
be. She had imagined him to be good, solid,
dull, and probably a shrewd man of business;
now she saw that only her first two adjectives
held. He might not see everything, but he
saw what he looked at. The trouble really began
in his never having looked at his wife. He
had accepted her, proposed to her, married
her, and she had done all the rest. The chances
were that she would go on doing it till she
died, unless some one interfered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What he wants,” said Helen of Troy to
herself, as she continued the conversation, “is
a shaking, and that is what he is going to get.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After dinner Horace accompanied them to
his smoking-room, and Anastasia cleared the
field.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Edith,” she said, “do you remember my
giving you an old silk shawl when we stayed
on the lakes; it was pretty, and warm, and soft,
and fresh, like one of the little clouds we used
to see hover over the lovely garden? I have
an idea I want that shawl back to keep always;
do you know where it is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the bottom of one of my old trunks I
expect, where I keep my treasures,” she said.
“I could send it to you, perhaps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want it right away,” said Anastasia
calmly, in the tone which took for granted that
what she wanted right away would be immediately
forthcoming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I’m to get it?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re to get it,” said Anastasia, “and
you needn’t hurry back, for I want to talk to
your husband about his boy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Horace looked at Edith affectionately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She can share all that,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re very kind,” said Anastasia, with hidden
irony, “but anyway I want that shawl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Edith left them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Mr. Lestrange,” said Anastasia, suddenly
sitting up and fixing him with her eyes,
“I’m not going to talk to you about your son
much. I’ll say this, and then I’ll leave the
subject alone. He’s not like you. I guess
he’s like that picture you’ve got on the mantelpiece--the
face is selfish, tyrannical, weak and
mean. Hush! I see you’re going to tell me
she’s dead. I know she’s dead, and Edith’s
alive. She’s alive! How long are you going
to keep the living woman buried and the dead
woman taking all her share of life? How long
is Edith to play second fiddle to a memory
which isn’t even true? If your first wife had
lived you’d have been worn tired of her by
now. Do you suppose she’d have said, ‘I’ll
give my heart and every quivering nerve to
serve this man’s comfort? I’ll starve every
sense I have got to give him friendship, since
he’s so blind he won’t take more? I’ll not let
pain, or time, or just resentment for a wrong
he has allowed to take place against me make
me bitter, or old, or blunted’? Would your
dead wife have acted this way, Horace Lestrange?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Horace looked at his patent leather shoes
fixedly. Once he tried to interrupt her, but
the tense sharpness of her voice struck his down
into silence. Something stirred in his heart
that was not all anger and indignation--it was
pain--it was recognition! So he breathed
hard and said nothing. And for a moment the
pitiless voice was still. Anastasia was watching
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When a man looks down at his shoes,
you’re moving him,” she observed to herself.
“You can’t tell which way he’s going, but he’s
being moved.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she went on:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I came here expecting to find you selfish
and stupid,” she said; “and you’re neither.
You’re a live man, and yet you’ve lived with
this woman ten years and not loved her; you’ve
looked at her and not seen her; you’ve taken
all she had to give, and you’ve never counted
what it cost her to give it to you. Oh, you’re
slow, you English--you’re slow!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’re quick to act,” interrupted the man
opposite her gently. He was still looking at
his shoes, and he spoke very quietly, but Anastasia
suddenly thrilled; she was not accustomed
to be thrilled by anything a man said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose that’s the meaning of English
history,” she thought to herself; aloud she
merely deepened her note of scorn:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Quick?” she said. “Mr. Lestrange--ten
years? I’m afraid it’s not quick enough.
Do you know what happens when a woman is
unhappy too long? She gets used to it. The
habit of unhappiness sets in, the heart gets
eaten up, she gets haggard, and old, and sad;
and not all the king’s horses and all the king’s
men can make the queen take to her throne
again! (That’s my own alteration, and rather
a good one.) The truth of the whole matter,
Mr. Lestrange, is that you’ve made a domestic
hack of a woman who had the spirit of Joan
of Arc⁠--”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What on earth are you saying about Joan
of Arc?” asked Edith’s voice suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anastasia started. Horace never turned
his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was saying,” said Anastasia, “that she
was burned alive at a stake by the English intellect
and the French nerves!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve found the shawl,” said Edith, “but
the pink’s turned almost gray in twenty
years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anastasia laughed shortly. Edith looked
quickly at her husband; in a moment she knew
that something had taken place--the very room
seemed tense with recent passion. A look of
anxiety came into her eyes. What had Helen
said or done? She tried to stem the silence
with the thin stream of talk which is against the
current of thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anastasia rose and held out her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve got to get home in time to oversee my
packing. I leave to-morrow,” she said, “and
I’m going to write your boy a line, Mr. Lestrange;
don’t you or Edith worry. I’ll make
things as easy as I can, and youth’s elastic.
It doesn’t break quickly. He won’t do anything
violent, you can depend on that; he talks
conversational suicide, and that’s pretty safe.
Just whistle me a taxi, will you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They went out into the hall with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Horace said nothing. Once his eyes met
hers. Horace’s eyes were blazing with fairly
steady anger, but it was not all anger. Edith
looked white and tired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I never going to see you again, Helen?”
she murmured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In twenty years’ time,” said her friend.
“Shan’t I make a nice old woman?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Horace shook hands with her, and suddenly
Helen of Troy smiled at him--it was a golden,
appealing, melting smile. Her eyes took it up
and held his in a kind of friendly laughter.
Horace smiled back grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sure,” he said, “I needn’t wish you
success.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think I’ve got it?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I think you’ve got it,” said Horace
Lestrange.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Edith kissed her, and standing together
in the soft May weather the husband
and wife watched her drive off into the night.
Helen of Troy did not look back at them. She
knew that they stood there together and loneliness
was at her heart like a knife. What
were all the shadows that surrounded her--the
easy captives, the shallow victims of her radiant
beauty--to that quiet union of strength?
Countless, countless, they thronged the courts
of memory, and unreal as the false dawn heralding
the long gray hours they passed away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, my God!” said Helen of Troy. “My
men fight for me, but they leave me, and they
never give me rest!”</p>

<hr class='tbk104'/>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m very tired,” said Edith gently to her
husband. “I think, if you don’t want me, I’ll
go upstairs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come into my study just one moment,” he
urged. “There’s something I want to talk to
you about.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more the anxiety flashed back into his
wife’s eyes. What had happened? What
had Helen said? She followed him quickly
into his room and closed the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, I don’t want to talk to you,” said
her husband suddenly, and at the sound of his
voice it seemed to Edith as if the whole earth
changed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a moment she was held--she was immersed--she
was lifted into uncontrollable joy.
His arms were round her and his kisses were
on her hair, her cheek, her forehead, quick as
his tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Edith,” he murmured, “my darling, all
these years!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, no Horace,” she cried, struggling desperately
against his pity, against the terrible
tenderness which seemed to drown the weak resistance
of her heart. “I was never unhappy.
Did she tell you I was unhappy? Why, I’ve
been--you’ve been--oh, Horace, Horace!
You’ve been pitying me--I can’t bear that,
you know--not that--let me go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pitying you!” he laughed; he turned her
face back with his hand and gazed into her
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I love you,” he said quickly. “I love you
<span class='it'>best</span>--do you understand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And suddenly all the sad habit of the years
fell from her, the weariness, the dull fret, the
days of sober agony--they were as though they
had never been.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The miracle of love swept her tears down
into an ocean of bliss and carried them into
laughing waters. Horace pressed his lips to
hers; and they were all lost--the long intolerable
hours--in the simplification of a kiss.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>he Pinsents never saw any reason why
they shouldn’t be modern without--as
they expressed it--going too far.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They didn’t believe in the sheltered-life system,
but that was perhaps because they rather
under-estimated their own idea of what constituted
a shelter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were certain risks, of course, in allowing
your daughters to play mixed hockey,
smoke cigarettes and belong to a suffrage
movement (they could attend meetings, but
weren’t to throw stones). Still, it was strange
how little harm these concessions to modernity
had done the Pinsent girls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bernard Shaw rolled off them like water
from a duck’s back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Somewhere between the ages of fourteen
and seventeen Mrs. Pinsent presented her
daughters with an approximate definition of
life. Agatha yawned and Edith said, “Oh,
dear! We knew all that ages ago.” For a
moment Mrs. Pinsent became agitated. Had
they, in spite of the healthiness of their surroundings,
come in contact with evil influences?
But she was reassured when Agatha explained
that they had picked it up from rabbits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose, who was more sensitive and less observant,
gave her mother more trouble than the
others, but she acquiesced at last, that God must
know best, though it all seemed rather funny.
They were not to earn their own livings because
later on--(later on being the term in which the
Pinsent parents envisaged their retreat from
this world) they would have plenty of money;
but they were expected to develop hobbies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The eldest girls developed splendid hobbies.
Agatha, who was the plainest of the three, became
a lawn tennis champion with a really
smashing serve. Edith distinguished herself
by writing a history of one of our western
counties. She rode all over it on a bicycle and
stayed at vicarages by herself. She earned a
hundred pounds by this adventure and had a
particularly pleasant notice in the “Spectator.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose was rather slower at taking anything
up. She had had pneumonia when she was at
school, and it had left her nominally but not at
all obstructively delicate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She played an excellent game of hockey and
was her father’s favorite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was really for Rose’s sake that they all
decided to go to Rome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They thought Rose would almost certainly
settle down to something after that, and it
would be good for Edith, who, now she had
finished Somersetshire, might like to begin on
Rome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She could at any rate compare the different
types of architecture. A friend of hers, a Mr.
Bunning, said there wasn’t any architecture in
Rome, but you could never be quite sure what
Mr. Bunning meant. Edith hadn’t been quite
sure for several years--nor apparently had
Mr. Bunning, but perhaps their going to
Rome might help him to find out. Agatha
was very good-natured about it; she said she
thought Rome would do as well as anywhere
else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Pinsents were a most accommodating
family and though, of course, they sometimes
quarreled, it was all in a loud, direct, natural
way, which generally ended in chaff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They never quarreled with Rose as much as
with each other because of her having been
rather delicate, still they chaffed her a good
deal. She wouldn’t have liked it if they
hadn’t.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They knew they weren’t like other families
of their class and standing; they prided themselves
on talking to people in railway carriages
and even crossing the Channel. Of
course, they were particularly good sailors but
even if they hadn’t been they would have been
nice and friendly and not at all stuck up about
being sick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Agatha was thinking of marrying a Canadian
who took most magnificent back-handers,
Edith was still wondering what Mr. Bunning
meant, but Rose was perfectly free.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She’d had two proposals, but both of them
had been from men she had known all her life
and liked most awfully--but not in that way.
So that she’d had, as Mrs. Pinsent put it to
her husband, “quite a lot of experience for
twenty-one and none of the bother of it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Pinsent growled and said that if Rose
married the right kind of man she never would
have any bother.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pinsent looked thoughtful; she didn’t
want to think that Mr. Pinsent was the wrong
kind of man, it would have been dreadful after
being married to him for thirty years. Still,
she couldn’t honestly have said that she hadn’t
had any bother with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Probably Mr. Pinsent had forgotten it;
men do not remember that kind of thing in the
same way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They chose a French hotel in Rome because
they thought it would be more Italian, and
when they arrived there everything was just
as foreign as possible, which was what the
Pinsents wanted--provided that they could get
enough hot water.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Hotel le Roy was even for Rome extraordinarily
“black.” Its <span class='it'>clientèle</span> was composed
of French priests, their sisters, ladies
of pronounced age and severity, one or two
French families of prehistoric claims, small
means and a son at a seminary, and a few
Dutch Catholics who were, if anything, blacker
than the French, but distinctly pleasanter to
the English. Black French Catholics do not
like English Protestants. The war may have
softened this feeling, but this episode took
place a year before the war, when the <span class='it'>Entente
Cordiale</span> was looked upon as a Socialist
blunder to be sharply counteracted in private
by a studied coldness of manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pinsent, whose French the whole
family relied upon, did nothing to improve the
situation. She said to Madame la Comtesse
de Brenteuil, who couldn’t very well help going
up in the lift with her, “Isn’t it a pity
the Vatican shuts so often for church things?
They say we sha’n’t be able to get into the
Sistine chapel in Holy Week, and one of my
daughters is writing an article on the Sibyls--it’s
really most annoying!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame de Brenteuil looked at Mrs. Pinsent
as if she were a smut that had fallen on
her sleeve; then, with a weary irony, she observed,
“Perhaps, Madame, the English do not
realize that the Holy Father is a Catholic?”
Mrs. Pinsent was eager to reassure her as to
Anglo-Saxon intuitions. She said, “Oh, yes--we
quite understand his own personal views--but
it isn’t as if Rome really belonged to
him, is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fortunately the lift stopped. It was not
Madame de Brenteuil’s <span class='it'>étage</span>, but she got out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After this incident no French person in the
Le Roy spoke to Mrs. Pinsent or her
daughters, so that it was rather difficult for
Léon Legier to begin--especially as he was
a third cousin to the Comtesse, and <span class='it'>lié</span> to almost
everybody there. He had made up his
mind to begin from the moment that Rose Pinsent
dropped a breakfast roll and blushed as
she stooped to pick it up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had never seen such a blush before on
any woman’s face, and any color he had failed
to surprise upon a woman’s face he had
naturally supposed could not exist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apparently it did, for Rose had it. Her
blush was as fine in hue as that of a pink tulip
and as delicate as a winter cloud at dawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It swept up in a wave from her white throat
into her pale, silky, fair hair, and the fact that
she suddenly discovered Léon was observing
her did not tend to decrease her color. Léon
Legier made his opportunity that evening in
the hall. The porter was explaining to Mrs.
Pinsent what time to start for Tivoli the following
morning. His English was limited
and he altered the train hour to suit the convenience
of the foreign tongue. The greater
inconvenience of missing the train had not occurred
to him until Léon intervened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Subsequently Léon discovered that almost
all the porter’s other information suffered
from similar readjustments of language, and
he and Mrs. Pinsent sat down in the lounge
to revise the day’s excursion. Mrs. Pinsent
should, perhaps, have thought of her
daughters, but Léon gave her no time to think
of her daughters. He focused her attention
upon herself. She felt herself young again,
almost dangerous; the young man before her
apologetic, diffident, with exquisite manners,
was so obviously attracted by her and intent on
all that she had to tell him, she had not the
heart to cut the conversation short. Later on
Mr. Pinsent joined them. He was delighted
to find another man to talk to in his own
tongue, and who was obviously acquainted with
the name of Lloyd George.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It fortunately never transpired that Léon
had confused the name of the then Chancellor
of the Exchequer with that of a horse who had
won the Derby.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Pinsent told Léon what the English
Government really meant and attacked the
Italian railway system. Léon listened politely,
and it was only at the end of the conversation
that Mr. Pinsent discovered his
young foreign friend was after all merely
French. Not that Mr. Pinsent minded
Frenchmen--but they could hardly be held responsible
for the state of Italian railways.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of his nationality, however, Léon
was able to give Mr. Pinsent the name of a remarkably
good wine to be procured at Tivoli;
he regretted that the best place to lunch required
a slight knowledge of how to order
Italian dishes. Mr. Pinsent said it was a pity
Léon wasn’t going with them. Léon only
hesitated enough not to appear over-eager; his
deprecatory, half-delighted eyes sought Mrs.
Pinsent’s, and she said quickly, “But perhaps
you could come with us?” Léon produced his
card. The Pinsents gave him theirs on which
was written “Rocketts, Thornton-in-the
Hedges,” and on Léon’s was written, No. 9,
Faubourg St. Germain, Paris, and there was
no one there to point out the deadly disparity
between the two addresses.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER II</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>he next day was glorious, a spacious,
sunny, golden Roman day. The air
across the Campagna was delicate and keen.
The Cascades at Tivoli fell in tumultuous
rushes out of their purple caverns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tiny temple of the Sibyls caught itself
up against the sharpness of the sky. It hung,
perilous and delicate, above the cliff like a little
weather-beaten storm-tossed shell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon made no attempt to talk to Rose.
He hardly looked at her, but he persistently
observed her. He saw that she had in some
sense which had been denied her family,
imagination and warmth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He surprised in her a sympathy of attention
different from the playful kindness of her
sisters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Agatha and Edith were from the first jolly
with Léon. They cultivated, with masculine
acquaintances, a slightly jocular tone, and the
humor of this was deepened, of course, by
Léon’s being a Frenchman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They gambolled cheerfully about him, much
like heavy sheep dogs good-humoredly greeting
a greyhound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon accommodated his pace to theirs, he
met them half-way, but he privately thought
they weren’t like women at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took Agatha round the little temple and
Edith to the foot of the highest waterfall. He
let their niceness (for he recognized with a rare
leap of the imagination that they were being
nice to him) expand into unconscious revelations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He allowed their frank communications to
slip over the polished surface of his manner
like leaves borne on the waters that dashed past
them. Once or twice he arrested the floating
leaves with the point of his stick, and once or
twice in the flood of Edith’s careless chatter
he held, very slightly, the point of his mind
against a special revelation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gathered that the Pinsents were very
well off. It wasn’t that they ever spoke of
money, but the tremendous amount of things
you had to have, the bother of <span class='it'>salonslits</span> and
the burden of expensive hotels filtered through
their wider statements of having to think twice
as to whether they’d go on to Sicily or not.
They deplored prices, but they invariably chose
the best of what there was. Léon listened
carefully, but he hadn’t at first any real intentions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose pleased him. She was an unknown
English type. A strange creature, as independent
as if she were married, and as innocent
as if she had never seen a man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He decided to devote himself a little to
studying her, and in order to do this he had,
of course, to accept the Pinsent family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Mr. Pinsent he could only be attentive.
He found him an English club and was delighted
to observe the increasing use which
Mr. Pinsent made of it. Mrs. Pinsent, however,
was comparatively easy to handle. She
was a woman with the maternal instinct, and
with her Léon found it easy to be candid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He told her that he had just finished his
military service and was now taking a little
“voyage” before settling down. He talked a
good deal about his mother, who occupied herself
with good works in Paris; his father he
mentioned less, and the works that occupied
him not at all. Nevertheless, it could be seen
that he had a great affection for both his
parents and no brothers and sisters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I expect that’s why he likes,” Mrs. Pinsent
explained to her husband, “to be so much
with the girls.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was three days before Léon found himself
alone with Rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had begun to feel a little out of this
gay stranger’s intimacy. It seemed to Rose
as if Léon purposely avoided her, and yet, in
a way, which was very strange to her, their
eyes sometimes met, and then he seemed to be
telling her something as direct as a penny and
as articulate as the cobblestones of Rome.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then all of a sudden, breathlessly, without
preparation, she found herself alone with him
in the Campagna.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Pinsent had said that the girls were
on no account to go outside the walls of Rome
by themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hadn’t made it perfectly clear why he
put this obstacle to their general freedom, but
he’d mentioned when pressed by Agatha,
malarial fever and savage Abruzzi sheep
dogs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I expect I shall just have to go to a
gallery instead,” Rose explained to Léon in
the hall. “Edith has gone off with some one to
see a fountain, and won’t be back for hours.”
Léon hesitated, then he said, “How far does
the wonderful English freedom extend? Is it
an impertinence that I should offer to take you--wherever
you wish to go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, thank you very much. Yes, of course
I could go with you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Rose answered
a little slowly. It seemed to her in some
strange way that her freedom had ceased to be
menaced by her father and mother, but not to
have become any the more secure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She couldn’t have said that she disliked
the sense of danger, but she knew quite well
what increased it. It was Léon’s saying as
they stood for a moment outside the street
door, “Do you know it is since three days--I
have been waiting for this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>They took the tram to San Giovanni Laterano,
and as it shuffled and shrieked its clamorous
way through narrow streets and wide
piazzas, under old yellow walls and through
long white modern tunnels, a new sensation
came to Rose Pinsent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had always supposed that what she liked
best in a man was his being tremendously
manly, and by manly the Pinsents meant impervious
to the wills of others, abrupt in
speech, and taking up everywhere a good deal
of space.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Léon was masculine in quite a different
way and yet no one could doubt his possessing
that particular quality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The form it took with him was that Rose
became suddenly conscious of his physical
presence. She noticed as she had never
noticed in any man before, his smallest personal
habits, the flutter of his fine hard eyes,
the scrupulous neatness and grace of his person,
and, above all, the alert and faultless
precision with which in any direction he met
her half-way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave her from moment to moment the
whole of his indulgent intensity. No man had
ever looked at her like this before, so read her
mind and forced her in return to read his own!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The tram was crowded and Léon stood
above her, holding on to a strap and looking
down at her with laughing eyes. “You are
thinking something of me, Mademoiselle,” he
said at last. “Confess it is a comparison, not,
of course, to my advantage. Tell me, then,
to whom are you comparing me, in what do I
fall short?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose tried to frown. “Why should you
suppose I am thinking of you at all?” she ventured.
Léon laughed softly. “Why indeed?”
he murmured. “And yet why should
you not? Here you are, you and I; we have
not yet exchanged half-a-dozen words, and
now we are to be together for, I hope, three
hours, and all these last days I have been
waiting for these hours--planning for them,
arranging, as it were, my life to meet them.
Surely you, who have not prevented my obtaining
them, must now be giving a thought to
what I am like? It would be droll to go for
a ride on a strange horse and not to look
at it, not question a little its character, how
shall we put it--its pace? Would you think
less of the companionship of a man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose drew in her breath sharply. Léon
had a way of putting things which was very
exciting, but not, perhaps, quite nice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” she said, “of course we have thought
of you--Mother and Father, they thought you
were--” she paused, breathless. Léon came
to her assistance. “Respectable? Oh, yes,”
he said easily. “But that doesn’t go very far,
does it? Simply to go for an expedition with
some one who is respectable! Your excellent
Mr. Thomas Cook could provide you with
that. You might even procure for a few
francs more a gentleman to give you a lecture!
Really, Mademoiselle, I had flattered myself
that your imagination had dealt with me a trifle
more directly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose tacitly admitted this claim. “Agatha
and Edith thought you awfully jolly,” she said
hurriedly. “So I didn’t see, I mean I didn’t
mind when you suggested coming out with
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon laughed again. “But I am afraid,”
he said, “that I sha’n’t be in the least with you
what I was like with Mademoiselles Agatha
and Edith--‘awfully jolly.’ I do not think
of you in those terms. You will have to decide
for yourself and not take anybody’s word
for it what I am like to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose said nothing. She was glad that they
had to get out at the foot of the Lateran steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They took a little carriage which went very
fast through the swollen, sallow suburb; it soon
left behind it the trams, the cobblestones and
the shuffling wine carts. Almost at once the
Campagna was upon them, vaguely breaking
away from the farms and the eucalyptus trees
into soft-breathing, deep, unbroken emptiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They wandered out over the grass to the
ruin of a villa, an old pink tower and a group
of umbrella pines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It asks to be sketched, doesn’t it?” Léon
observed. “And now you will have to be very
definite, Mademoiselle. It won’t do for you
to suppose that you can judge of the Campagna
without a glance, as if it were merely a
new masculine acquaintance!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He opened her camp-stool and gravely
placed himself on an old wall behind her.
“Vous y êtes,” he asserted, “begin!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Rose didn’t begin. She had been
thinking of what he had asked her. Perhaps
she hadn’t been quite frank. The Pinsents
as a family thought it a sin not to be quite
frank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I <span class='it'>was</span> thinking about you,” she admitted.
“I mean myself; I thought--I thought you
weren’t at all like an Englishman!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon laughed gently. “What a discovery,”
he said. “I am not like an Englishman--I!
And did you want me to be? You are disappointed,
perhaps?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wonderful pink color deepened in her
face. “No,” she said, “I am not a bit disappointed--I
like people to be different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Mademoiselle,” he said with
sudden gravity. “You relieve me very much,
for that is one thing I could not change for
you--I could not be less a Frenchman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still she did not begin her sketch. “You
are tired?” he asked her. “Rest then, and
don’t trouble to make a picture on that little
strip of canvas. Nothing you can do there
will, I assure you, be half as successful as what
you are doing, by just sitting where you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was sure he was flirting now, but what
she wasn’t sure was how to stop it. She
wondered if Edith or Agatha knew, but it
flashed across her in a terrible moment of disloyalty
that perhaps neither of them had ever
been put to the proof. “I don’t think you
ought to say that kind of thing--” she said a
little uncomfortably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why not?” Léon urged. “Why do
you not wish me to take pleasure in your
beauty? And if I take it, would it not be
rude and ungracious not to express it? For
my part I believe only in the truth. If it is
agreeable--good! Let us enjoy it. If it is
disagreeable, let us bear it. But why should
we try to avoid it? Besides we can never avoid
it. If we choose to shut our eyes to the truth
it will take us by surprise. Is that the way
you like to be taken, Mademoiselle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose was not a stupid girl; she gave Léon
a fleeting glance; there was just the delicate
hint of laughter in it, her lips trembled at the
upturned corners. “I don’t like being taken
at all,” said Rose sedately, returning to her
sketch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It occurred to her afterwards this was not,
perhaps, the best way to stop flirting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They came back rather late for tea, but
Mr. and Mrs. Pinsent were not at all uneasy
about them. They didn’t look feverish and
they hadn’t seen any savage Abruzzi dogs.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>F</span>or a Frenchman of the type of Léon
Legier there are a great many ways of
being in love; there are also several goals.
You needn’t, as he himself expressed it, finish
the game in order to have received your entertainment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the case of Rose Pinsent, Léon wasn’t
at first very serious, he was out for the fine
shades. He had never had an intimacy with
an Englishwoman before. It was simply a
nationality he didn’t know, and he found it
touching.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For her sake he led the Pinsents in compact
and cheerful batches into unknown churches
and gave them on unfrequented hillsides
splendid Roman views.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He never made a visible point of the few
moments alone he managed to snatch with
Rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She took these moments with a certain unexacting
grace which pleased him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was as if she had a special pleasure which
never amounted to expectation in his presence.
Her grave blue eyes never claimed him, but
when he signaled his own joy into hers--he
met with no rebuff. He had passed certain
barriers with her and she made no attempt to
set them up again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was secretly afraid, not of him, but of
being so different when they were alone together.
She tried very hard to be just the
same as she was when those queens of chaff,
Agatha and Edith, presided over their small
festivities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had never supposed before you could
have two relations with the same person, without
doing anything wrong, and yet the most
rigid of her scruples failed to warn her that
when she and Léon were together they did
anybody any harm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose would have stopped all “nonsense”
at once; what she couldn’t stop was the
gradual dangerous tenderness, growing touch
by touch under the hand of a master.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tried not to think too much about Léon,
and as long as he was with them she found that
she succeeded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Everything became so interesting and so
vivid--but when Léon was out of their sight,
buried in obscure private affairs, hidden, perhaps,
by his French relations whom he persistently
excused to the Pinsents as being poor
dear people, so terribly provincial and shy!
Rose found Rome wonderfully little of an
absorption--she was forced to consider that
what she really needed was, like her sisters,
some definite active goal. Her mind became
set upon a hobby. She felt if she had that,
it wouldn’t really matter whether Rome was
interesting or not. She could not have told
quite how the idea came to her; perhaps it was
because little Italian children in the streets
looked so sweet--but she suddenly thought
she would like, when she got back to England,
to have a nice little home in the country
for children to get well in, quite poor people’s
children--only they would be washed there,
of course, and probably have curly hair. She
told Léon about it one day when they were
in St. Maria in Trastevere and had snatched
a moment to go off by themselves into the
sacristy, to admire what Baedeker so aptly
describes as “the admirable ducks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Papa,” Rose explained to Léon, “had been
so kind, he thought it could be managed.”
For a moment Léon looked in silence at the
admirable ducks--and then he laughed a
gentle, caressing laugh and flushed a little,
fixing his hard bright eyes on her upturned
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Mademoiselle,” he said, “hasn’t it
occurred to you that to have your own children--nice
little healthy ones--wouldn’t that be
just as amusing and not quite as expensive
for Papa?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed as if Rose’s very heart had blushed
under his eyes. She wanted for a moment to
go away from him--to hide from out of his
sight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She said quickly and vaguely, “Oh, I don’t
know--one doesn’t think about such things.”
Léon said, “Doesn’t one? I assure you I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hadn’t said any more, but it was the
moment of his own intention. He saw as
clearly as the lines of the mosaic on the wall--the
prospect of a definite new life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This mere study of a delightful English
temperament should develop into the most
serious of all his affairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A girl as beautiful and as innocent with such
a command of so compliant a parent (for little
homes in the country for sick children must involve
an elastic pocket on the part of Mr. Pinsent)
struck Léon as a rare and favorable opportunity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After all, he meant to settle down some day.
His mother wanted it, and his father’s extravagance
had done much to make a good
match difficult in France, and Léon liked
Rose, he appreciated her. She was innocent,
but she wasn’t eager--she made no advances
towards him--she was modest without being
in any danger of striking him as a fool. She
knew, for instance, when to hold her tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was the only one of the Pinsent family
who had the good taste to ignore an awkward
little episode which took place at about this
time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon had been very fortunate hitherto, he
had also been skilful. Rome is not a large
town, nor one in which it is easy to keep one’s
acquaintances definitely apart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon was at this time carrying on two perfectly
different affairs. There was the Pinsent
affair--which hadn’t arrived and which
took up a good deal of time, and for which he
chose a certain type of occupation, but there
was another affair--which had arrived some
time ago, very much less serious, of course,
but also requiring time and a background from
which he had so far succeeded in eliminating
any appearance on the part of the Pinsent
family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Pinsent upset this arrangement by
altering at the last moment, and without
notifying Léon--the program prepared in advance
by Léon and Mrs. Pinsent. Mr. Pinsent
decided that he would go to Frascati and
walk up a hill to a place called Tusculum.
There wasn’t much to be seen when you got
there--but what he suddenly felt was that he
needed more exercise and they could get lunch
at the Grand Hotel coming back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was at the Grand Hotel that the incident
happened. Léon saw them coming inexorably
across the garden in close formation,
waving parasols and shouting their unfettered
greetings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He notified the brilliant lady who was his
companion that they must instantly retire in
the opposite direction. His companion stared,
not at him--a glance had explained him to her
quick intelligence--but at the Pinsent family.
She said under her breath, “The English have
no families--they have tribes--this appears to
be a savage one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon never moved a muscle of his face--he
turned his back resolutely upon the approaching
Pinsents, and took his companion
into the hotel--where he asked for a private
room. If the Pinsents chose to follow him
there--it would be a pity--but everything
would be at an end. There are forms that
must be preserved even in the face of self-interest.
Léon knew that he would never forgive
Rose if the Pinsents went any further.
But they didn’t go any further--Rose diverted
their attention--she loudly declared
that it wasn’t Léon--and insisted on remaining
in the garden. She owned when pressed
that the walk had been too much for her.
She felt not exactly faint, but that she would
rather not go indoors. The Pinsents had their
lunch under a magnolia tree in the garden.
It was very like a picnic, and Agatha and
Edith prepared a splendid method of “roasting
Léon” when they got hold of him once
more. They effected this seizure in the hall
of the hotel that evening. They upbraided
him roundly with the exception of Rose.
Léon denied steadily that he was ever at Frascati,
but of course not--how could he have been
there and not rushed to greet them? It
wasn’t conceivable--they had seen his double!
Agatha and Edith described with much wealth
of detail the lady he was with (only the
English could walk so merrily into dangerous
places).</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon looked graver still. He turned to
Rose. “And you, Mademoiselle,” he asked,
“were you under the impression that you saw
me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It certainly did look exactly like you,”
Mrs. Pinsent murmured, looking rather
troubled. “I particularly noticed the hat.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lots of people wear hats like Monsieur
Legier,” Rose said, looking away from Léon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was the only one of the party he finally
failed to convince.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He did more than admire her then, he respected
her. There is no taste so perfect as
that which permanently conceals a fact which
is awkward for others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose concealed it, but she paid for her good
taste by her tears.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>L</span>éon planned in advance the setting for
his proposal. He would make it in the
English way, to the girl herself. Léon had
never proposed marriage before, and he gave
the affair his best attention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Baths of Caracalla are never very
crowded and at certain times of the day they
are extraordinarily solitary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon knew one of the chief excavators and
it was part of his idea to take the entire family
of Pinsent with the exception of Rose into the
underground regions. The excavator, who
was an enthusiast, could be calculated to hold
them there for a full hour. Rose, who never
liked underground temples, agreed easily
enough to remain in the open air, and Léon
disappeared with the others. She was a little
puzzled over Baedeker’s description of the
Baths of Caracalla, once she got the tepidarium
in her head she felt she could get on
quite easily, but the tepidarium eluded her.
The great roofless, sunny space, wouldn’t contract
itself reasonably, into a guide book, and
then she heard Léon’s returning footsteps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has anything happened?” she asked in
some alarm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is for you to say,” answered Léon
with unusual gravity. “For my part I have
found you--and that for the moment is
enough.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t you mean to stay down there,
then?” asked Rose in some bewilderment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never in the world,” said Léon more
lightly. “Am I the kind of man to engage
myself with the temple of <span class='it'>Mithras, je m’en
fiche de Mithras</span>! I beg your pardon--I
should say, in the phrase of your American
cousins, I have no use for him!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no one but themselves in the
Baths of Caracalla, the great pink walls
stretched spaciously around them, the blue sky
benignantly overhead, under foot the fresh
spring grasses spread like an emerald fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose we ought to go all over it properly,”
Rose asked a little wistfully. Léon
shook his head. “Why should we do that?”
he objected. “Let us leave propriety to
Mithras. If ancient history is true, he stood
much in need of it. For ourselves, let us sit
down in this corner--under the shelter of the
ivy--and look at the pink blossoms in front
of us. If you had not informed me how
serious it is to pay compliments, I should have
told that tree--that it was very nearly as
pretty as the English complexion; but as I am
a very truthful man and have no wish to curry
favor with any one, I should have added, not
quite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose smiled a little tremulously. She said
nothing, but she hoped Léon would go on
talking. She turned her eyes on the almond
tree; its pale pink flowers hung above them
like a little cloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A silence fell between them, a significant,
tremendous silence. Rose became aware that
she was alone with Léon in a way in which she
had never been alone with any one before.
Their privacy was as breathless as danger.
In a moment more it seemed to Rose something
tremendous would have happened like
an earthquake or a volcano, but probably much
nicer than these manifestations of nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she knew that it had happened already.
Léon had caught both her hands in his.
“Mademoiselle,” he asked her in a queer,
strained voice, “Has any man ever kissed you
before?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She lifted frightened, fluttering eyes to his--they
were wonderful in their candor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No!” she whispered. “No!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Alors!</span> You will not be able to say that
again!” he said firmly, bending towards her.
But though his eyes held hers with the intentness
of a hawk, he waited for her answering
surrender. She startled him by the urgency
of her protest. “Oh, don’t! Don’t!” she
pleaded. “Please let me go!” Instantly he
released her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t like me enough?” he asked her
in surprise. “Do you think I am such a brute
that I would kiss you against your will?
Why, never in the world! That is no kiss,
that is not a mutual pleasure. But why do
you say ‘No’ to me, Rose?--for your eyes--your
eyes say ‘Yes’!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no!” she answered quickly. “I know
you wouldn’t do anything I shouldn’t like, but
don’t you see I can’t let you--it’s just because
I--I do like you so much.” She turned
her face away from him, her eyes filled suddenly
with tears. “Please don’t say any
more,” she urged. “I know with you it’s different--please
go away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Léon sat down near her. “I will do
anything in the world you want,” he said
firmly, “except go away. After what you
have said you cannot expect me to do that.
You must listen to me a little now--are you
listening, Rose?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to say something that will give
you pain,” Léon began slowly. “I had not
meant to say it, I had meant, if I were
fortunate enough, to give you pleasure, but
when you say you like me you make me feel
that I must not be a coward. Rose--I am a
bad man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned startled, unbelieving eyes upon
him. What he said was painful to her, but
she had been expecting a different kind of pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said gravely. “It is true. I am
not in the least worth your regard. I do not
think I shall make a good husband even for
you. I say this to you because I am going to
add the little thing I had hoped might give
you pleasure. <span class='it'>Je vous aime</span>, Mademoiselle.”
The words had a sharper significance in his
own tongue. After he had said them he
looked for the first time away from her, towards
the almond blossom tree. “You are as
fine, as beautiful as that tree,” he murmured,
“and oh, my dear, you know as little--as these
frail pink flowers--about a man like me.
How can I ask you to trust me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fear crept into her eyes. “Léon,” she
whispered, “what you said just now was true,
wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I am bad?” he asked bitterly. “Yes--it
is true--it would be a poor joke, such an
assertion, just now, though perhaps it is a
poorer truth. It is also true that I would
have kept it from you--if you had not greatly
moved me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No--I didn’t mean that,” she said gently.
“I meant the other thing you said.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He turned quickly. “That I love you?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose nodded. “Because,” she whispered,
“I--I would take the risk--if you loved me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took her hand and kissed it, and then
with a fierce gentleness that seemed impatient
of its own restraint, he drew her into his arms
and pressed his lips to hers. “You child!
You child!” he murmured. “God punish me--if
I ever fail you--” But even with his lips
against her lips--he envisaged his own failure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew away from him. “Léon,” she
said, “I want you to let me go home alone⁠--”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He looked at her in surprise--a moment before
she had seemed so helpless, so incapable
of asserting her surrendered will, and now,
facing him with her steady eyes, she seemed an
independent, self-reliant woman. For an instant
he wondered if he thoroughly understood
her, but he put this misgiving away from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must do whatever you wish, of
course,” he said gently. “But it is--not that
you are unhappy or that you are afraid?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned towards him fiercely. “Yes,”
she said, “I am afraid. How can any one be
as happy as I am and not be afraid?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He drew a long breath, he had forgotten
that this was her first love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They walked together to the gates in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Across the road the mortuary chapel opened
its big iron doors to let a common Roman
funeral pass out. Rose shuddered, and turned
wide eyes of terror on Léon. “Oh!” she said,
“How can God let anybody die!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He put her into a carriage, soothing her
as best he could, but his own hands trembled.
He had not realized how serious this affair was
going to be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was as serious as death.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER V</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>he Hotel le Roy became a place for
consultations. Everybody interviewed
everybody else. The hall, the stuffy red
salon, the tiny, damp garden, even the lift became
indispensable for hurried conversations,
but of course none of them had the least result.
Léon, from the moment of his engagement,
had taken rooms at another hotel--this
was at once more <span class='it'>convenable</span> and also much
more convenient. His French relatives were
furious. He let them consume their fury
among themselves, and told them when he had
to see them, that their interest in his affairs was
charming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Pinsents were all trying to be large-minded,
uninsular and modern, but they
didn’t like it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Pinsent made a false start. He told
Mrs. Pinsent that the engagement was out of
the question. Mrs. Pinsent suggested his seeing
Rose for himself and talking it all out.
Mr. Pinsent refused hastily, clinging to the
one plank of masculine security. “Aren’t
you the child’s mother?” he demanded. Mrs.
Pinsent made no attempt to deny this salient
fact. She merely said, “I’m afraid Rose will
say she wants to see you about it.” Mr. Pinsent
knew what that meant. If he saw Rose
he was lost. But as a matter of fact, he was
lost already, without seeing Rose. Mrs. Pinsent
had lost him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Mr. Pinsent had finished saying that
the engagement was all nonsense and that he
wouldn’t hear of it for a moment, she said he
was perfectly right, but it wasn’t as if Léon
was an Italian, was it? Paris was really not
at all far from London when you came to think
of it, and Léon was most obliging, and dressed
quite like an Englishman, “and after all,” she
finished, “we haven’t anything against him,
have we? He told me himself he wasn’t a
good Roman Catholic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the end Mr. Pinsent had to see Rose, and
after this he agreed to a further interview with
Léon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The interview was not, from Léon’s point of
view, at all what it should have been.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Pinsent had no sense of form. He
hardly listened to Léon’s statement of his affairs,
and he made no statement at all of his
own intentions. He walked up and down the
rather cold, deserted salon talking about Rose
having had pneumonia when she was twelve,
and how sensitive she was, and how much he
would miss her. She was quite the best bridge
player of the three girls, and her golf was
coming on splendidly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said he thought Paris hardly the kind
of place for a real home life. He hadn’t seen
any there, some years ago, when he and Mrs.
Pinsent stayed in the Rue de Rivoli. He
added that he couldn’t really feel as if Rose
would like continually hearing French spoken
all round her. It was quite different from
being abroad for a time and coming home again
afterwards. Mr. Pinsent laid his hand on
Léon’s shoulder and sentimentalized the situation
in a way that shocked Léon’s whole
nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Emotion should take place (enough of it,
for a mere betrothal) between Léon and Rose;
it shouldn’t take place between Rose’s father
and Léon, and as for talking about the feeling
of a man for a good woman, nothing could
have been more out of place. You simply,
of course, didn’t talk of it. Mr. Pinsent, however,
did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course we must go into everything very
carefully later on,” Mr. Pinsent finished, rubbing
the back of his head. “Rose seems to
have set her heart on you--we must all hope
you can make her happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Mr. Pinsent shook hands with Léon
and seemed to think there was nothing more
to be said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They never did go into anything later on.
In the first place, Madame de Brenteuil refused
point blank to meet Mrs. Pinsent.
“If,” she said to Léon, “your mother sanctions
your engagement, we have decided to permit
ourselves to speak to the girl. Her family we
will never accept. More you must not demand
of us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Legier wrote two letters--one to
Léon in which she said if he was sure of getting
£500 a year, and the girl was healthy--and
agreed to bring up the children as Catholics--she
supposed it was better to close with it,
though Heaven knew how they would fit things
in, the English temperament being as stubborn
as wood, and his father most unaccommodating
when he was there; and another letter to Rose
in which she welcomed her into the family and
said what confidence she had in Léon’s choice,
and how she and her husband looked forward
to the brightening of their future lives by the
sight of their children’s happiness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Monsieur Legier wrote a third letter which
Mrs. Pinsent translated to her husband. He
said something about a lawyer in it, but Mr.
Pinsent said nothing would induce him to see
a French lawyer, English ones were bad
enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose didn’t give anybody time to do much
more. She announced that she wanted to be
married at once and spend her honeymoon at
Capri.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She could buy what she needed in Rome and
finish getting her trousseau together in Paris.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had set her heart on going to Capri for
her honeymoon and there wasn’t any use anybody
saying anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She didn’t even pay much attention to
Léon, who ventured on one occasion to wonder
if Capri was very gay?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We sha’n’t want to be gay,” Rose said a
little soberly. “We shall just be perfectly
happy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon said no more. Of course he expected
to be happy, but he had never in his life been
happy when he wasn’t a little gay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose saw very little of Léon during their
brief engagement. They were both immersed
in preparations for the wedding, but the little
she saw was like the vision of a Fairy Prince.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was gallant, delicate and intent. Nothing
about Rose escaped him. He knew with a
marvelous tact from moment to moment what
would please her best.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was (but of course Rose didn’t know
this) the correct attitude for a Frenchman
engaged to be married.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the marriage approached, Mrs. Pinsent
had moments of secret doubt. She knew it
was very silly of her, but Rose was her youngest
child, and marriage by two consuls and a
Cardinal wasn’t at all like being married
properly in your own church at home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went so far one evening as to go into
Rose’s bedroom under the pretext of borrowing
her hairbrush, just to see if her child was
quite happy. Mrs. Pinsent’s hair was long
and thick like Rose’s, it had been the same
color when she was Rose’s age. She sat in
an armchair by the bed and thought that Rose,
whose hair was done in two long plaits, looked
terribly like she used to look when she was ten
years old.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” she said, “I like Léon so much.”
Rose smiled and blushed and snuggled further
into the rather hard second pillow reluctantly
conceded to her by the Hotel le Roy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Mamma, I know,” she said, “and he
loves you--isn’t it nice?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pinsent reflected. “All the same,” she
said, “men are very strange. I mean even
our own men. You’d think you could tell
what they’re like before you are married to
them, but you can’t--you don’t even know for
quite a long time afterwards.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose looked unconcerned. “It’s so funny,”
she said, “but I feel as if I knew Léon better
than if he was an Englishman. You see, he
tells me more. I can’t quite put it to you, so
that you can understand, but I think it’s his
being so much more expressive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Mrs. Pinsent. “Only that isn’t
what I mean, you know. I wasn’t thinking
of what they said, any of them. I don’t think
you can go by that; when they’re in love,
they’ll say anything.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose hesitated. “But, Mamma,” she said,
“don’t men--don’t they <span class='it'>ever</span> stay in love?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pinsent resorted hastily to the hairbrush.
Almost all married women dislike this
question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, in a sense,” she admitted. “But
when they get used to you they aren’t always
very easy to hold.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose sat up very straight and slim. “How
do you mean--<span class='it'>hold</span>?” she asked quickly.
Mrs. Pinsent brushed her hair well over her
face. She hoped Rose wasn’t thinking about
her father. It was an unnecessary fear, Rose
wasn’t thinking about any one but Léon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” Mrs. Pinsent explained, “I think
there comes a time in almost all happy marriages
when a man has almost too much of
what he wants. He gets, if one isn’t very
careful, and perhaps even if one is--a little--a
little restive and bored. You see, men never
have as much to amuse themselves with as
women have--and that makes them take more
interest in what they <span class='it'>do</span> like even if it isn’t
good for them--and other women (whom they
wouldn’t really care for a bit--if they saw
enough of them) may make an appeal to them
just because they’re <span class='it'>not</span> their wives. Of
course, it mayn’t be at all like this with Léon,
dear, only you’re going so far away from us--and
he’s a Frenchman, and perhaps they
don’t think of marriage quite as we do. I
have never read Zola, of course, but I believe
there is rather a difference in the point of
view.” Mrs. Pinsent faltered--she felt
through the cascade of her hair--Rose’s inflexible
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What would you do, Mamma,” Rose asked
quietly, “if anything--happened like that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Pinsent drew a long breath. For a
moment she was almost sorry that Bernard
Shaw hadn’t had a sharper effect upon her
daughter’s imagination. Mrs. Pinsent wasn’t
anxious to explain what she would do. She
only wanted to be vague, and at the same time
helpful; her own case had been quite different,
there had been the children, and, besides, Mr.
Pinsent wasn’t French.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We rather thought,” she said, “of staying
on for some time in Rome, and then going to
Paris for the first part of the summer. We
should be quite near you then--and Agatha
could go back to England for her tennis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I couldn’t ever leave Léon,” Rose said
strangely, “whatever happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, dear, of course not,” said Mrs. Pinsent
soothingly, then she started quite afresh and
began plaiting her hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your father wanted me to tell you,” she
said, “that he’s going to have your allowance
settled upon you--and upon your children--that’s
£500 a year, and later on you’ll have
even more, of course, like your sisters, but the
money is in an English bank, and it is quite
your own, but you’re to have trustees as well,
your father has seen to all that. Léon was
so nice about it. I knew he would be. He’s
been so generous and charming and most
thoughtful.” Mrs. Pinsent got up and bent
over her daughter. “You are happy, Rose?”
she whispered. “You do feel safe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose lifted her undeterred, terribly triumphant
eyes to her mother’s. “I feel as safe,”
she said, “as if an angel loved me.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>E</span>verything had been done, the
last trunk was packed, the last joke, not
a very good one, accomplished by Agatha.
The two elder sisters, tired out and unequal
to their natural play of spirits, had gone to
bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose flew downstairs to the telephone. The
Swiss manageress, a sharp-tongued, good-hearted
woman, rose wearily and shouted
through the receiver. After a violent exchange
of reproaches with an irate porter at
the other end, she accomplished the feat of
getting hold of Léon, and put the receiver
into the girl’s hand. “He is there, Mademoiselle,”
she said with a curious glance at the
girl’s flushed face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, thank you,” Rose murmured. “Léon,
Léon, are you there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it is Rose?” His voice answered a
little as if he was surprised that it was Rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she said quickly, “I want to see you.
Can you come at once?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something has happened?” he asked
anxiously. “Something has gone wrong?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose reassured him. “Oh, no--nothing,
but I felt suddenly as if I <span class='it'>must</span> see you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a moment’s pause, a buzzing
sound came across the wires, and then Rose
heard a strange voice--it sounded like a
woman’s saying very slowly, “<span class='it'>Mais--c’est la
dernière nuit?</span>” And then Léon’s again,
“I am very busy to-night, Rose--this that
you want to see me about, is it important?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was surprised at his hesitation, and surprised
at her own insistence. It seemed to her
suddenly very important that she should insist.
“Please, please come,” she said urgently.
There was another pause, then Léon said
again, “Is it a command?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment earlier she would not have said
that it was a command, but her wish to see him
had been mysteriously sharpened into a strange
imperative instinct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t my wish a command?” she asked,
trying to laugh. But Léon did not echo her
laughter. “Very well, then,” he said, “in ten
minutes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The big red salon was empty. For the first
time Rose noticed the yellow lamp, the blue
velvet tablecloth, the enormous imperishable
roses in bulging angular vases under the great
gilt mirror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had been so happy all these weeks she
hadn’t really seen what anything was like, and
she had hardly ever been alone for ten minutes.
Now she was alone. She remembered with a
little smile that Léon had once said of the salon
that as an interior it was not seductive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Pinsents did not use irony, but Rose
thought she rather liked it. In ten minutes
precisely Léon was with her. Fortunately
Madame de Brenteuil had gone to bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon entered quickly, looking about him as
if he had expected one or more of the Pinsent
family to be in attendance. Only Rose, feeling
suddenly rather small and very far away,
stood under an imitation palm close by the
mantelpiece.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon took her hands, kissed them, pressing
them, and letting them go in one quick movement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am here,” he said, drawing a seat up close
to her. “Well--what is this thing that has
suddenly become necessary for us to talk
about?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose looked at him questioningly. Really
she hardly knew what it was that she wanted to
see him for, perhaps it was after all only to
see him! To count over her riches, to feel the
wonderful golden coins slip through her eager
fingers. Only now as she met his eyes it
seemed to her that he shut her out. He had
a strange hard look, and though he smiled, his
smile itself had a new quality, a quality which
seemed to put her a little to one side. “I don’t
quite know, Léon,” she murmured. “I did
want to see you--but I think I must have had
some reason.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon glanced through the glass door of the
salon at the back of the Manageress’ head.
“Let us hope so,” he said cheerfully, “for it is
ten o’clock and I see no one here but Madame
at the Bureau.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Father was here--but I sent him away,”
Rose explained conscientiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon gave an odd little laugh. “To-night,”
he said, “you are very imperative. But you
see we are all your slaves. He went--I came--well--what
do you wish of us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Léon,” she whispered, frightened by the
coldness of his voice, “weren’t you glad to
come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gave himself a tiny shake as if he were
trying to pull himself into a fresh frame of
mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But of course,” he said, “you are adorable.”
To a critical ear his tone lacked conviction,
but Rose’s ear was not critical; that is
to say, not yet. She gave a little sigh of relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I know what it was I meant to
say,” she stated, “Mamma has been talking
to me about marriage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah--!” said Léon quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something she said,” Rose continued,
“made me wonder. You see, I had always supposed
when you were in love--that was enough.
But what she said made me wonder if perhaps
it didn’t matter a good deal <span class='it'>how</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon looked a trifle puzzled, but he was also
amused, his hardness was beginning to melt under
the spell of her wistful loveliness; something--some
other spell, perhaps, receded from
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Bien sur</span>,” he murmured, looking into her
eyes. “It matters how one loves.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I couldn’t help thinking,” Rose went
on with gathering confidence, “that you knew
rather more about it than I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon’s eyes flickered under the yellow lamps.
It was almost as if they were laughing at her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he said caressingly, “yes--that is always
possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You see,” Rose explained, “all along I have
felt as if you knew me, and what I wanted, and
how you could please me, so astonishingly
well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon smiled. He did not tell her that compared
to other women--many other women--she
was easy to please.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” Rose went on, “in a way I understand
you. I told Mamma that! Better
than if you were English, because we’ve talked
so much, you see--but I’m not sure--not quite
sure--that I know all the things you don’t like.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What I wanted to ask you to-night was--will
you always tell me what you want and not
mind if I’m stupid and don’t know things until
you tell me? You need never tell me more
than once--I shall always remember.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had touched him now, touched him so
much that he sprang to his feet and walked
hastily to the window. She could not see his
face. She waited patiently and a little anxiously
for him to come back to her. He said,
when he came back, and stood behind her chair:</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are adorable,” but he said it quite differently,
he said it as if he really found her
adorable. “It is true,” he said at last, very
gently and tenderly. “There are things that
we must teach each other, and to-night I will
teach you one of them. You should not have
sent for me here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, but why, Léon?” she cried. “It was
just the last night”--her voice faltered--some
queer little trick of the brain forced into her
memory the voice she had heard on the telephone.
That woman, too, had said to somebody
that it was the last night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In the first place,” he said, still gently, but
a little gravely, “you should not have seen me
at all--on the evening before our marriage, it is
the reason itself! You should have spent it
with your mother and sisters. It surprised me--it
surprised me very much--your sending for
me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She flushed crimson. “Do not think I blame
you,” he said quickly. “But I am a Frenchman,
and you must learn a little how we think.”
Rose bowed her head. “And in the second
place,” he said, “my very dear child--you must
not constrain me to come to you--it is my delight--my
joy to be with you--be very careful
that you never make it my duty! I am your
lover--to-morrow I shall be your husband. So--so
you will remember, never try to constrain
me to be with you--let me come, let me go, do
not try to hold me, and do not seek to know
where I have been.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But,” she cried eagerly, “Léon--I didn’t
mean to do anything like that! I--I was
frightened. I wanted you! Just to see you!
I never will again--I mean--I don’t think--do
you?--I shall ever be frightened again. It
wasn’t that I meant to--oh, what a horrible
word--constrain you--only I thought you
would be alone and wanting me, too!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mon Dieu!” he cried, with sudden exasperation.
“Of course I want you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew back a little from the savage light
in his eyes--he had caught her arm suddenly
and roughly--but in an instant he had himself
in hand. “Now I am going,” he said. “You
are not to be frightened any more. You are
mine, my sweetheart, my wife, my darling!
How I love the pretty English words!--and
you will love a little your funny French husband,
will you not?--and forgive him, if you
do not always understand him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He took her very gently in his arms, and
kissed her troubled eyes and put his lips lingeringly
and tenderly to hers. There were tears
on her eyelashes, but she smiled bravely up at
him. “I will never forget what you have
said,” she murmured, “and I will love you always.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he went away. After he had gone, it
occurred to Rose that she was to belong to him,
but if they were to be happy he must not belong
to her. She did not put it quite as sharply as
this, but she reminded herself that the great
thing was for Léon never to feel bound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame came in from the bureau to put out
the lights. “You will not need them any more,
Mademoiselle,” she asked, “now that Monsieur
has gone?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Rose. “Thank you very much.
Madame, are you French?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Mademoiselle,” the Manageress replied.
“I am a Swiss from Basle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you know French people?” Rose insisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame shrugged her shoulders. “I know
most people,” she observed. “Even Arabs, I
once kept a hotel in Egypt; but why do you
ask, Mademoiselle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wondered,” Rose said, “if you thought
them--the French, I mean--very difficult to
please?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No people are easy to please,” Madame replied,
putting out the lights with a sharp twist,
as if she disliked them. “And all are unpleasant
when they are not pleased. I do not say
the French are more unpleasant than the
others. They know what they are about and
they don’t ask for the moon and expect to get
it for two sous, but what they ask for--that
they do expect to get no matter what it costs
others that they should have it. In general, I
find the French have very little heart. I have
no complaint to make against them. They are
orderly, they do not waste time, they have the
sense of how to behave. But I find it is better
to expect nothing from them, and to remain independent.
Is there anything further you require,
Mademoiselle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose thanked her again and turned thoughtfully
away. Madame, with the last switch in
her hand, looked curiously after her. “The
English,” she said to herself, “are not practical.
Nevertheless, Madame de Brenteuil is quite
wrong about them. They mean no harm.
The whole family Pinsent walks about with its
eyes shut, as innocent as the newly baptized.
They are a race of mystics without manners.
It is what comes of a meat breakfast so early in
the morning. The senses become clogged. I
must not forget to remind Alfonso that the
father Pinsent wants bacon with his eggs.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>hey had been married a week--a tremulous,
ecstatic, amazing week.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed to Rose made up of all the laughing
colors of the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were surrounded by the sea, clear and
limpid as a shallow pool, the great deep bay
gleamed and shone about them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Out of it the Islands rose like flowers.
Capri uneven, wild and blue, Ischia tulip-shaped
and tall--Posilippo and its attendant
isles like a fallen spray of blossoms; and in
Capri itself the whole spring lay bare to the
sun.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The South was like Léon--it was beautiful,
but it was strange.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On their first evening they had driven swiftly
up the hillside; the air was cold and keen; the
small mountain ponies galloped through the
quick-falling darkness and just for a moment a
breath of fear touched the triumphant bride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She longed for something familiar, something
that wasn’t even beautiful, but to which
she had grown accustomed. She didn’t put it
to herself quite like that--she only wished she
hadn’t had to leave her fox terrier at home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moment passed and other richer moments
took its place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Love was just--what without expecting it
Rose had most desired. No one could have expected
any one to be as wonderful as Léon.
He spilt his soul into his passion, his ardor
filled their hours, there was no way in which he
did not color her life. She felt herself like
some poor common pebble transformed into
purple and rose color by the touch of the sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It never occurred to her that when the tide
recedes the color goes. She did not know that
Léon’s passion was a tide, and she did not believe
that it would ever recede.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They explored everything in Capri, the ruins
of Tiberius’ villas, the many colored grottos,
the little stray paths that led between high
walls to the heights of Capri--and everything
they saw Rose loved. But best of all she loved
their own familiar garden of the Hotel Paradiso,
surrounded by violets, where Léon taught
her to smoke cigarettes and where the stars
swooped down on them in the velvet dark
evenings, leaning just over the tops of the little
stunted trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had everything she wanted then, but
most of all she had Léon, rarer and sweeter
than the voilets, more astonishing and limitless
than the southern stars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course he had his faults. Rose accepted
these limits of natural frailty with eager tenderness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was jealous, fierce and a little hard on
anything that interfered with his crowning absorption.
Rose had heard him speak with
cold, incisive sharpness to a waiter who interrupted
one of their soft, interminable garden
intimacies; and Léon was indifferent, intensely
indifferent--to anything or any one but her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She couldn’t be said to mind it, but she noticed
it; it made her hope that nothing would
ever happen to her--it would be so awful if it
did--for Léon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then one day he ran up the outside staircase
which led to their rooms with a peculiar, excited
expression in his eyes. Rose came out to meet
him, and together they leaned over the balcony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such a funny thing has happened,” he explained.
“I’ve met an old friend, isn’t it
strange?--he is here also on his honeymoon.
The wife--I had not met before--you must
know them. I have asked them to-morrow to
tea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose hid a moment’s dissatisfaction. “Are
they French, Léon?” she asked a little nervously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But of course, yes, Parisians of the most
Parisian. Do you object to that?” he demanded
impatiently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh no!” she explained. “Only you know,
Léon dear, my French is so bad!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He didn’t say it was adorable, which was
what he usually said, though he never allowed
her to attempt it when they were together. “It
is time you learned French,” he said. “You
can’t go on like this.” Then he looked at her
with strange critical eyes. “You mustn’t wear
that to-morrow,” he said coldly. “What have
you got that you can wear? Madame Gérard--dresses.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose flushed. “Dearest,” she answered,
“you know everything I’ve got--I thought
you liked my clothes--they were all I could get
in Rome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are, nevertheless, extremely poor,”
Léon pronounced with an air of finality. “I
can’t think why you have no manner of putting
on your clothes. There is no character in them,
no charm, no unexpectedness. You dress as if
you wanted shelter from the cold. Also none
of your things have any seduction--they are as
dull as boiled eggs. You cannot live in Paris
and dress like an English country miss.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose felt as if she would die if Léon would
not get that cold look out of his eyes. She lost
her head under his impassive scrutiny. “Must
I meet them?” she pleaded. “The Gérards, I
mean. They don’t sound a bit my kind of people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But of course you must meet them!” said
Léon angrily. “Naturally, since you are my
wife--you are not my mistress, to be hidden
away at such a time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Léon!” Rose exclaimed--his words struck
at her like a whip lash. She turned quickly
away and went into their room. She felt as
if she could not stay any longer with Léon.
In five minutes he rejoined her--not the
strange, disagreeable man who had spoken to
her like that, but her husband Léon. He was
full of tender apologies. He couldn’t, he explained,
think what had made him so nervous.
Perhaps it was because Capri was so quiet, one
resented anything that broke into it. But,
after all after to-morrow they need see very
little of the Gérards--Raoul wasn’t a great
friend of his--he was, however, an interesting
man--a well-known and very fine singer. He
was a good deal thought of in Paris. Perhaps
one day he would sing to them.
Madame also was musical. She adored her
husband’s voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose said that would be lovely, and she asked
Léon how long the Gérards’ honeymoon had
lasted. Léon said longer than theirs--a fortnight
or three weeks, perhaps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Madame’s idea, Capri. They had
taken a villa so that Raoul could practise comfortably.
Raoul would naturally have preferred
Naples. “She is romantic, however,
like you,” Léon murmured, kissing Rose’s soft
white throat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he sighed a little and moved restlessly
about the room. “For Raoul,” he murmured,
“I am not so sure. Capri isn’t very gay.”
This was the second time Léon had mentioned
the lack of this quality in Capri, and neither
time had Rose paid any attention to it. She
was not a Frenchwoman, and she had no idea
that Léon attached any particular weight to
the idea of gaiety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon kissed her again. This time he did it
a little remorsefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were to have tea in the garden under
the almond blossom trees. Léon was to go into
Capri and return early with cakes and roses,
but before he went he inspected Rose’s dressing
table. He frowned helplessly at her dreadful
lack of accessories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Before she goes,” he explained to Rose,
“Madame will no doubt wish to tidy her hair
and readjust her veil. Why is it you have
nothing here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose gazed at him. “But, Léon,” she said
gently, “I have pins and brushes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon exploded suddenly into one of his picturesque
whiffs of anger. “Mon Dieu! Are
you a woman at all?” he exclaimed. “You
have no powder, no rouge, no scent. You have
nothing here on your dressing table that a
woman should have! Oh, you everlasting creature
of soap and fresh air! How can I explain
you? How can I explain anything? I shall
go mad!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Afterwards he calmed down. He would, he
explained, buy what he could get at Capri.
Fortunately Rose did have silver-topped boxes
and bottles; these could be filled to look as
natural as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose agreed; she would have agreed to anything
to please him, but she was surprised at
the amount of things Léon apparently considered
a Frenchwoman would find necessary in
order to reassume her veil and tidy her hair
after a tea-party. Besides, Rose didn’t like
scent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At half-past four Madame Gérard appeared,
her husband strolling a little behind her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two impressions flashed simultaneously
upon Rose; one was that Madame Gérard,
though distinctly smart, wasn’t particularly
pretty, and the other, that in spite of her lovely
clothes, her new husband, and the romance of
Capri, she hadn’t got happy eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her other impressions of Madame Gérard
she formed more slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Monsieur Gérard she instantly and wholly
disliked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was much older than his wife, and had a
bored, conceited air, and rather thick red lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stared a great deal at Rose, and said several
times over, when Léon introduced him to
her, that he was very much impressed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame was charming; she was charming
about the garden, about the tea, about the wonderful
English nation, and about Capri; but
she was charming in Parisian French. Neither
of the Gérards knew a word of English, and
Madame spoke in a cascade of little soft,
vanishing sounds, the significance of which
poor nervous, attentive Rose couldn’t possibly
catch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Monsieur Gérard, on the other hand, made
three separate emphatic attempts to talk to
Rose. Rose blushed and frowned and didn’t
suppose for a single instant that she had understood
what he said. She wouldn’t have liked
it at all if she had, but of course men couldn’t
say such things to ladies to whom they had just
been introduced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What was strange was that she could, she
always bewilderingly had been able to understand
Léon’s French, however fast or complicated
the rush of his talk might be, and what
was so odd, so uncomfortable and bewildering
was that Léon was saying really dreadful
things to Madame Gérard. Not that Madame
Gérard minded, on the contrary she seemed
particularly stimulated by Léon’s vivid attentions.
Nor that Monsieur Gérard minded,
either; he gave up his endeavors with Rose,
and seemed to resign himself to a silent but
perfectly good-tempered peace. He seemed,
though the idea was as preposterous as everything
else, to feel like a sentry who has just been
relieved after a too protracted exposure at a
difficult post. He ate heartily, and when he
had finished he asked permission to smoke, once
or twice he hummed something under his
breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was perfectly natural that Léon should
not notice Rose, you can’t in public single out
your wife for attention, and Madame Gérard
made the most valiant efforts to include her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Expressive, gesticulating, infinitely gay,
Madame drew, or strove to draw, the poor dull
little English wife into the swift current of
their talk, but she did not succeed, partly, no
doubt, because Rose was shy, but partly also
because Léon markedly wished to keep her out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose kept out. She made herself as busy as
she could pouring out tea and handing cake,
then she leaned back in her chair and tried to
look as if she enjoyed hearing Léon and Madame--what?--you
couldn’t call it exactly
talk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was the difficulty. It was more of a
game than a conversation, and a game whose
rules Rose had never learnt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Monsieur Gérard got up after a time, and
asked if Madame would excuse him--might he
examine the planting of the lemons? He was
madly interested in lemons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose gladly excused him. She heard Léon
ask Madame Gérard if this statement of her
husband’s was true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never in the world!” Madame gaily replied.
“He does not know the difference between a
lemon and an orange!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then let us,” said Léon, “also go and examine
something we do not understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose stayed where she was. Something had
happened to her little secret lovely garden, it
was suddenly vulgarized and spoilt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The scent of the lemons, delicate and pungent,
made her head ache. The pigeons came
to her, when the others had gone, and she fed
them from the crumbs of her first party. She
had always thought it would be so delightful
to give a party with Léon, but she had not supposed
that the party, as far as she was concerned,
would be composed exclusively of pigeons.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>A</span>n affair of importance had brought Monsieur
Gérard to the Hotel Paradiso. He
excused himself to Rose for wishing to consult
her husband privately. Rose accepted his excuses
sedately and retired to her balcony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She liked Léon to be consulted. It showed
how wise he was, that an older man, even if he
wasn’t very nice, should stand in need of his
judgment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was very interesting to watch the two men
walking up and down the garden. Léon slim
and smart, with his little unconscious air of
having arrived without premeditation at the
perfection of appearance. Monsieur Gérard
heavy, with a kind of sleepy uncertainty in his
movements, and the effect of forcible compression
about the waist. There was something to
Rose very repulsive in the muffled greediness
of Monsieur Gérard’s expression. He looked
at once selfish and burdened; it made her nervous
to see the two men together--for she had
an idea that the burdens of the selfish are apt to
be readily transferred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She could not hear what they said, but she
could see they were saying a tremendous
amount. First Monsieur Gérard would begin
emphatically with a puffy white forefinger attacking
the air. His shoulders, his eyebrows,
his hat were volcanically active, speech broke
from him in a cascade as overwhelming and
magnificent as the Tivoli Falls. Then he
would pull himself up abruptly, broken in upon
by another torrent from Léon. Even when
they listened to each other their attention was
as vivid as speech, and they were capable at moments
of catching each other’s speech without
discontinuing the rapid flow of their own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose thought their conversation must be
about an opera; and she was sure that if the
opera was like their conversation it would be
very exciting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were moments when she thought the
two men were angry, there were others when
the emotion between them seemed to rise up
like a sudden wind and possess the garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the whole it was Léon who was the most
excited--he repeatedly said “<span class='it'>Non!</span>”--but even
from the balcony Rose gathered in his passionate
negative a reluctance for it to be taken as
final.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They parted with great affection; there was
gratitude in Monsieur Gérard’s attitude, and
there was protection and soothing in that of
Léon’s. “But above all,” she heard her husband
say, “with women one must be practical.”
They shook hands three times, then Monsieur
Gérard waved his hat to Rose and hurried out
of the garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon rejoined her, lighting a cigarette; his
hands trembled a little, his eyes were intensely
bright. It struck Rose that he was restless,
more restless than usual.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He hummed a little tune to himself and then,
breaking off suddenly, told her to bring him out
her best hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It has an air,” he explained, “quite too much
of the Sunday. I want to eradicate it! A
tranquil hat afflicts me! It has no power to
move the heart. In a hat, one should have
peril. It should not be an accident, I admit
many are! But it should have an intention
with a hint of danger. Pass me the scissors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose passed him the scissors. “I hope,” she
ventured, “that Monsieur Gérard hadn’t anything
dreadful to say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She thought it couldn’t have been very
dreadful, for Léon was looking distinctly
pleased.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, he put a decent amount of gravity
into the headshake with which he answered her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Everything is of the most complicated,” he
assured her. “The affair Gérard has literally
come to pieces. The marriage has as little integrity
as the inside of a volcano. They walk
on broken glass. It is no longer a honeymoon--it
is an inferno!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose cried out in horror. “But what has
happened to them?” she asked anxiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a long story,” said Léon, who had by
now completely unpicked her hat and was trying
the trimming upside down, and rather liking
the effect. “But I shall tell you as much as
I can. One must make the troubles of others
one’s own--must we not? Both our religions
agree upon that. <span class='it'>Non?</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>“It appears, in the first instance, the marriage
was of Madame’s making.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She had the idea--common to many women--that
she was born to be the wife of a great
artist. As a matter of fact, no women are
born for that, because no great artist should
have a wife. They should have from time to
time a tragic union with a mistress--that develops
them; wives do not. Raoul was the only
artist Madame knew. She was twenty-three,
an heiress, and as you see for yourself a charming
little woman of the world. She made a
good impression upon Raoul. He discovered
that marriage with her would have a solid foundation.
Now he has got it and naturally he
does not know what to do with it. Above all
he finds that Madame considers herself ill-used.
She is, as I told you before, romantic. She
expected a grand passion, she knew him capable
of one, but she did not grasp that it could never
be in her direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I find it myself a little bourgeois of her to
expect Raoul to develop such a thing for a wife.
Do not look so like the Sunday hat, dear Rose!
Remember their marriage was a French one.
Ours is English--therefore we were in love.
Still, of course, both were marriages!” Léon
manipulated the hat afresh, it was beginning to
look less and less like Sunday. Rose said nothing.
She had a silly feeling that if she spoke
she might cry. She was very sorry for Madame
Gérard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That, then, is the grievance of Madame,”
Léon went on. “She is young, excitable and
disappointed. You have that on one side. I
must say that I think she lacks management,
but for all that one sympathizes with her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“His grievance is, however, more serious still.
Because he has no grand passion for her, Madame
turns round and asserts that there is no
real marriage between them!--that, in short, if
she cannot have the silver moon, she won’t be
put off with very good cheese of the day. You
follow me? She does not wish to be a wife to
Raoul.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” cried Rose incredulously, “oh, Léon,
surely Monsieur Gérard did not tell you this
about his <span class='it'>wife</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But yes--” said Léon calmly, “why not?
I, however, consider that if Madame lacks
management, Raoul lacks <span class='it'>souplesse</span>. Things
should never have been allowed to reach such a
sharpness. I don’t say he could have given her
a grand passion, one can’t invent such things,
but he might, all the same, have lent himself to
the situation during the honeymoon. If a good
woman cannot have a honeymoon, what can she
have? The type will die out if they are to be
starved all round.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean to say you want him to pretend?”
Rose asked. She spoke quietly, but the
feeling behind her words made Léon throw
down the hat and catch her hands in his.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah!” he said, “you Queen of the Puritans!
No! not pretend--but he might--mightn’t he?--have
for the moment have gone a trifle in advance
of the facts?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose withdrew her hand from his. “It
seems to me,” she said, “all of it, simply horrible!
I don’t understand. How could he
come here and tell you such things--to talk
about his wife and her feelings? Why, it’s all
so incredibly <span class='it'>private</span>! It’s as dreadful as if
he’d killed her. I don’t think I should have
minded it half so much if he had. And what is
the <span class='it'>use</span> of it, Léon--why did he come to you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, that is why I told you at all,” Léon explained,
a little crestfallen. “Of course, I
knew you would shrink from this affair. It is
natural that you should, though I cannot, for
my part, see why, in a strange land, surrounded
by Italians, the poor Raoul shouldn’t be allowed
to consult a compatriot and a friend.
However, it is really for my assistance that he
came, and I cannot give him that, Rose, without
your consent. It is simply a question of
whether or no you are sufficiently magnanimous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you mean?” asked Rose, more
frightened still. “You know I can’t talk
French properly, and if I could I shouldn’t
know what to say to people like that!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I didn’t ask you to mix yourself up in
it,” Léon answered reassuringly. “It is, however,
perhaps even harder for most women--what
I have to ask of you! It is to stand aside
and let me mix myself up in it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shivered a little. “Oh, but why,” she
asked, “should you be mixed up in it? We
only saw them yesterday!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon picked up the hat again. “It appears,”
he said, “that I managed to entertain
Madame yesterday. Poor thing! she has been
living the life of a tortured Romantic. For the
first time Raoul heard her laugh, saw her smile,
and he became attracted by the idea. He
thought if I managed to amuse her a little, she
would be less tragic, and then, after a time, she
might submit her case to me, and I could, little
by little, you know, much as I have done with
this hat--a feather here, a ribbon there, readjust
the situation. Such things have been
done, you know, by people of tact, and to save a
marriage when one has oneself made such a
success of one’s own--isn’t that a duty one perhaps
owes, in return for one’s happiness?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose thought the situation over, that is to
say, she felt it over. Here and there her heart
winced under the probes she gave it. She knew
that Léon was magnificent, and she felt humiliatingly
conscious that she was not as magnificent
as Léon. She saw plainly enough what
was required of her. She was to stand aside
for the sake of these strangers, she was to give
up her honeymoon, she was to be alone, and to
let Léon spend his time with this French lady,
who was charming, and whom she could not understand.
She remembered what Léon had
said, that he must not be constrained, she remembered
it perhaps too well. Her whole
being centered in the desire to leave him free.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shut her eyes and prayed. Léon did not
know that she was praying, but he felt a little
uncomfortable. He was deeply sorry for the
Gérards, but there was no doubt that their complications
had made the Island of Capri more
amusing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose opened her eyes wide. “Léon,” she
said, “I want you to do whatever you think
right, and I will help you all I can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kissed her joyously. “There,” he said,
“the perfect wife! What a pity Madame cannot
hear you! She would see the path of happiness
without a lesson! Of course you will
help me. You will help me profoundly. Day
by day I shall bring you the history of my little
attempt. It is on your advice I will lean, the
drama of it will be for both of us an immense resource,
and I have a feeling that for all of us
it will have a happy ending!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose did not share the feeling. She picked
up the hat which he had finished and tried it on.
“It is very French,” she said doubtfully, “but
does it really suit me, Léon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah, you must make it suit you,” said Léon
a little ironically. “I cannot help you to that!
It’s all a question of how you wear it!”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>L</span>éon had, from the first, the best intentions.
He was to be the good comrade to
Raoul, the sympathetic counselor to Madame,
and for the situation in general a happy blend
of an olive branch, a dove, and a rainbow in
the heavens!</p>

<p class='pindent'>His shrewdness of judgment was only to be
matched by the lightness of his heart. For a
month many of his most salient gifts had been
lying idle. Rose had not asked for management,
and there had been in their easy-going
lovemaking no very great place for tact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon was on the look-out for difficulty, for
gulfs of temperament and training, efforts and
sacrifices and gently taught lessons, but after a
time his look-out ceased. Rose looked out.
She made the efforts, she learned his lessons,
before the need arose to teach her. In fact,
she saved him trouble, and there had been moments
when Léon found this a trifle dull. It
was different now; his skill was called upon at
every turn. Madame Gérard was a very unhappy
woman. She had had a spoilt childhood
and a sentimental and enthusiastic youth
guarded at every point from experience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All her adventures had been in her unfettered
dreams. She had dreamed that she
should marry Raoul, and then she had married
him. Life had brought her up very short.
She had believed in an exquisite and ideal relationship
and she had been given with terrible
promptitude Monsieur Gérard’s impression of
what constituted the marriage tie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had spoilt her dreams, he had shaken
about her ears the fullness of her life; but he
was still the man she loved. All other men
were but as trees walking, even Léon was only
a tree that walked. It was true that he walked
more and more frequently in her direction.
She took a certain notice of him, her heart lay
in the dust but it began to mean something to
her that Léon resented this. She felt through
the bitterness of her shame a tiny spark of returning
pride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a very tiny spark, it hardly amounted
to self-respect--but Léon guarded it and kept
it alight, as a man shields a flickering match
from the rough air. He flattered her grossly
at first because she was too sad to understand
subtlety. Afterwards, as her mind turned towards
him, he refined his flatteries. He kept
her a little hungry so that she should more and
more look to him for this nourishment of the
spirit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Madame Gérard, in spite of her grief,
was a kind-hearted little woman. She remembered
Rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We must not neglect her,” she would say
gently, “the little English wife. One does not
cure one unhappiness by making another.”
And Léon would explain that the English were
a strange race. They loved solitude, speechlessness
and wonderful long newspaper articles
about politics. Also Rose was learning
French from a nun and she didn’t care to make
a third in their little amusements until she could
talk more freely with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has a pride about it,” Léon explained.
“These cold, silent women are very proud.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should not have thought her cold,” said
Madame Gérard, thoughtfully. “She has kind
eyes. When one is very unhappy one notices
kind eyes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon led the conversation back to Madame’s
unhappiness and away from Rose’s eyes. He
had not meant to be disloyal to Rose, he rather
liked to think of her as cold and proud. After
a time Madame no longer tried to send him
back to Rose; she was a Frenchwoman, even if
she was broken-hearted, and she was not slow
to understand Léon. “This type,” she said to
herself, “will always be with some woman or
other--with me he is safe! I shall send him
back to her as he came even perhaps a little
wiser, a little more appreciative of her. I will
do her no bad turn, the little English wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Gérard had the best intentions, too.
She had even better ones than Léon, but neither
of them perceived that they had them in the
wrong direction. Nevertheless, for a time all
went well. Monsieur Gérard studied for the
coming opera season with a freer mind and in a
better temper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose took long lessons from the nun, and as
she slowly and painstakingly began to master
the intricate and exquisite language of her husband
she felt as if she were approaching his
spirit, and preparing for herself and for him a
fresh world of understanding and companionship.
Day by day Léon brought her, with
fresh enthusiasm, endless stories of his progress
with the affair Gérard. Some instinct in Rose
told her that by the length of these stories, and
by Léon’s absorbed, invigorated returns to her,
their love was still safe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She needed all the assurances that she could
get, for she was very much alone. She was
always just the same to Léon; she spread about
him the warm, wide sea of her magnanimity;
he was never to know she felt sad or strange, or
that she had a silly habit of almost crying when
she walked alone on the cliffs above the bright,
transparent sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He wasn’t to dream that she minded his
boating and driving and walking with Madame
Gérard, or that she kept explaining to herself
how natural it was for him to talk more and
with more gaiety in French, and not to care so
much as he used to for moonlight in the garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She succeeded so entirely in the effect of appearing
not to mind that she thoroughly annoyed
Léon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had been looking forward to a fresh
drama with Rose, a little visible but not fettering
jealousy, a scene or two, even a few tears,
wise and tender explanation on his part, and
passionate pleading upon her own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Rose’s passion was very quiet and it
never occurred to it to plead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had no such intention, but she made
Léon’s vanity smart, under her daily serenity.
“Is she made of wood--or of iron,” he asked
himself bitterly, “that she lets me live in the
pocket of another woman even during the
honeymoon? What have I to look forward to--centuries
of ice?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He knew very well that there was no ice in
Rose, but his bad conscience enjoyed resentment
very much. It was not only his vanity
that was injured, he began to be conscious of
a secret fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose was to be his guardian angel in this
affair--he mustn’t, whatever happened, be
allowed to lose his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He didn’t expect his wife to stop his doing
what he wanted, but she ought to be so effective,
so in the center of things as to prevent his
wanting it, and Rose wouldn’t come into the
center of things. She remained in the background,
trusting him. He felt the burden of
her confidence checking him at every turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was danger, and she didn’t see danger.
Was she going to walk straight through it, with
her wonderful blue eyes forever unaware?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She ought to have realized that however noble
a man is, and however unhappy a woman,
a situation in which, from the best motives,
they are constantly thrown together, needs
watching. A most unfortunate thing had already
happened. Madame had discovered,
from an unguarded remark of Léon’s, that he
had talked with her husband about her. Madame
Gérard had a constructive mind--if two
and two were anywhere about, it did not take
her long to arrive at four. Instantly she understood:
this new companionship, the devout
attention of her husband’s friend was nothing
at all but a plot between the two men to play
with her broken heart!</p>

<p class='pindent'>She knew their aim; it was to make her compliant
to the lowest needs of one who had not
so much affection for her as a stray dog for the
hand that strokes it. To say that Madame
Gérard was angry at this discovery is to underestimate
the uses of language. She was attacked
by a bitter fury of outraged pride.
Léon had brought back her pride, then, simply
in order to outrage it! But this time she kept
her head. Any woman can keep her head with
a man with whom she is not in love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Gérard knew herself to be standing
with her back to the wall, fighting for her life
against two men, one of them at least she could
injure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She gave herself a moment of despair, her
small hand clutched fiercely at a little stone beside
the path near which they sat--her hidden
eyes burned with unshed tears. For a long
moment she held herself in silence, while she
let Léon cover up his mistake as if she had not
heard him; then, being a practical woman, she
put despair away till afterwards: besides, despair
could only hurt herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a pity that in destroying Léon’s marriage
she should have to destroy Rose’s. Enraged
as she was, she thought of this; still, she
couldn’t stop to consider a woman who, if she
had had the least sense, would have interfered
in the whole affair long ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not angry,” Léon urged, “that I
should have touched on your sufferings with the
good Raoul?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame laughed softly and looked at Léon
with provocative, caressing eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You who know women--must know how
safe you are from me,” she replied. “Do I
look angry?” She did not look angry, but she
looked provocative, and this was the first time
that she had looked provocative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the difference between a battery
turned on and a battery turned off. Madame
Gérard, like all Frenchwomen, could use her
sex or sink it as the occasion required. Up till
now she had never used it, she had kept it steadily
in abeyance out of respect to Rose. Now
Rose had to go, respect had to go, everything
had to go--but her fierce rage against the two
men who were in league against her pride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was no wonder that Léon began to be
afraid, even though it must be admitted that
his fear was chiefly of a pleasurable nature, nor
that Monsieur Gérard should suddenly feel
that he had evoked rather more help than he
needed; nor that Rose should find herself not
only more alone but suddenly deprived of the
support of the long histories Léon used to make
to her, on his returns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He could no longer tell her what took place
between him and Madame; speech had become
a medium for something better not explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Gérard was the only one of the
group who appeared wholly at her ease; all her
energies were being freely used, and in the
direction she had chosen for them. She was
making her husband jealous, Léon infatuated
and giving the stupid English wife plenty of
time to learn French.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The good intentions of everybody began to
look a little like the fashion of the year before
last.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER X</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>I</span>t was part of their general attention to the
surface of things that Rose was never to appear
deserted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon and Madame tore themselves away
from her with public reluctance at the garden
gate; they rejoined her eagerly like creatures
reprieved, after a prolonged but obviously
penal absence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They even arranged between them times and
occasions when Monsieur Gérard should also
be represented, when the united four, like a
procession on parade, strolled before the watching
eyes of Capri.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The watching eyes of Capri are indulgently
accustomed to youth and change, they are incapable
of the element of shock, but they are
equally incapable of the delusion of a good appearance.
When Capri beheld Rose and Léon
issuing from the Hotel Paradiso on their way
to a “Thé Intime” at the Villa degli Angeli,
Capri was not hoodwinked by this overflow of a
dual domesticity, rather it laid a finger to the
nose and cried, from one doorway to the other,
“Behold!--a festa of knives!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a many-colored day in the late spring,
the bright air shimmered and danced like the
bubbles in champagne. The Villa degli Angeli
shone pillow-shaped and glittering in a
rose-hung garden. Wistaria streamed from
its porch, and cloaked like a shield its romantic
lovers’ balcony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inside the high-ceilinged, gilded little salon,
Madame Gérard moved gracefully to and fro--she
wore a white dress with touches of scarlet
and gold; her lips were very red, her cheeks
were lightly powdered, her eyes had a certain
sparkle in them, and the heels of her small white
shoes were thrillingly high. It struck Rose,
not for the first time, that there was really no
use being much prettier than that. Madame
Gérard greeted Rose with ecstatic pleasure and
Léon with a charming ironic gravity; behind
her from the gloom Monsieur Gérard moved
heavily forward. It was plain that he found
the occasion exhausting. Monsieur Gérard
easily exhausted most occasions, his was not a
revivifying nature; still, there was a certain dignity
in the way he murmured over Rose’s hand
that he was impressed, greatly impressed, by
her visit. She remembered that he had been
impressed before. Rose would have liked to
have said something pleasant in return, but it is
difficult to appear full of <span class='it'>savoir faire</span> when expression
is limited to requests for hot water, the
superficial qualities of dogs and cats, the time
of day, and the habits of railway trains.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose could talk quite easily about these
things by now, and she was also an expert in
weather and could have made herself into a
well of sympathy to an invalid, but for ordinary
tea-party purposes her French hung fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The burden of entertainment fell naturally
enough upon Madame. She was equal to it, in
all probability she had arranged her rôle in advance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The week had gone well with her. Monsieur
Gérard had been roused from practising operas
and from nervous hostility over his matrimonial
liabilities. He perceived that at one stroke
his liabilities and his security had been snatched
from him. He was jealous and had begun to
be a little eager; but Madame did not meet him
half-way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She no longer bored him to make love to her,
indeed she ignored any opening for his attention;
she lived exquisitely and extremely unapproachably
a life of her own. Monsieur
Gérard resented this; he hadn’t meant anything
so extreme, but he did not see his way to
put an end to it. Madame knew perfectly that
he was ready to put an end to it, and she had
arranged this occasion, both that he might be
given his opportunity and that Léon might receive
the punishment that he deserved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon had wanted, it appeared, to reunite her
to her husband. This was the height of kindness
on his part; she would repay him by showing
him that his efforts were a little in arrear of
the facts. But alas! once more she showed that
lack of intelligence to be found in the cleverest
of women when they are dealing with the man
they love. She understood the man--she had
proved it--but she muddled the love. She
should have hooked her fish before she dangled
it before the exasperated eyes of Léon, and
she should have remembered that it was only
half a fish--and half an artist. But at first
she was satisfied with the rôle of the perfect
wife--instantly she succeeded in exasperating
Léon. She drew her husband skilfully and
prominently into the front of the situation; she
did not praise him, but little by little she
tapped the fount of his successes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laid him out before her guests with delicate
touches that were far finer than praise.
It was intoxicating for Monsieur Gérard.
After a week’s complete indifference he found
himself a hero in his wife’s eyes!</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found himself also in the most comfortable
chair in the room (for with men over forty
a certain attention must be paid to an appropriate
background) and enjoying a wonderful
“gouter” in which his taste ruled supreme.
Lately Madame had not studied his taste, but
for the occasion everything his fancy desired
had been obtained for him. His future spread
before him in a rosy glow--after all this marriage
of his had not been a great mistake--he
rather wished he had not taken Léon into his
confidence about it; still, it was amusing to
watch the fellow’s nose slipping out of joint!
He would now have to return to his dull little
wife--that would be punishment enough for
any man!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon was a bad loser; he became first restive,
then actively hostile, finally sulky. Madame
turned his active hostility into gentle ridicule;
his restlessness served somehow to bring out
the grand nature of Monsieur Gérard. The
grand nature of Monsieur Gérard was not as
a rule, active; and Léon, confronted with a
specimen of it, sank into silent resentment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even this tent of Achilles was not, however,
left to him; it blew this way and that under the
delicate raillery of Madame. She noticed that
Monsieur was out of spirits?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She attacked Rose about it. “A woman is
responsible for all that happens to a man during
his honeymoon, is she not?” she asked her.
Rose, thinking that Madame was doubtful as
to the state of Léon’s health, told her painstakingly
that Léon was an “esprit fort.” Madame,
with a happy little shriek, proclaimed
that she was sure of it, but was not his wit like
Madame’s own--this afternoon, at any rate--of
the wonderful silent English type? Even
Monsieur Gérard laughed at this, but on the
whole Madame spared Rose; she kept as far as
possible her hand off her. She would gladly
have spared her altogether, and, in a sense, of
course, she was doing so. She was giving her
her husband back--not wiser, nor more appreciative,
and certainly in a far worse state of
mind--but for all that he would be returned
to Rose this afternoon not so very much the
worse for wear, as husbands go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For half-an-hour Madame Gérard took upon
her little supple shoulders the entertainment of
her guests. She was for that half hour like the
whole cast of the Comédie Française put together--brilliant,
exquisitely decorative and
incredibly, ironically knowing; then she turned
to her husband with her eyes like an innocent
caress, and said, “Now, <span class='it'>mon ami</span>, will you not
make music for us?” Monsieur Gérard was
not unwilling to use his magnificent gift.
Léon, who felt that the end had come, politely
echoed the request; and then Madame made
her fatal mistake. The game was hers--she
had only to stand aside and let it finish itself;
but she could not stand aside--nervously, with
happy flutterings, she must show them how she
followed her husband’s work, and how she
helped him: and she didn’t help him at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew out his music--it wasn’t what he
wanted to sing and he said so crisply; he always
knew what he wanted to sing. Then she said
she must play his accompaniment, so that he
could stand up and let his voice out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now Monsieur Gérard’s voice was not of a
quantity to be lightly let out in a small bird-cage
of a room; it would have been sufficient
to roll over Capri like a rock-stream. Also,
Monsieur Gérard was like a tiger to any accompanist
but his own, who was taking at the moment
a much-needed holiday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It counted for nothing at all with Monsieur
Gérard that his wife was dressed in white and
scarlet and gold and that she had roused in him
the temporary sentiments of attraction. From
the moment that she mounted the music-stool
nothing counted but her power of playing a correct
accompaniment without too much expression.
She had evoked the artist, and the artist
upsets everything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Monsieur Gérard began to sing; he modulated
his great dramatic voice, but the sound
of it shook the Villa degli Angeli; it poured
out on the dancing air with the majestic roll of
great billows breaking on the beach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame tinkled mildly and prettily on the
piano after him--too prettily of course, and not
very accurately. The little ineffective notes
were like a pee-wit chirping in a storm. In an
instant Monsieur Gérard had swept her from
the music-stool almost on to the floor. “You
have no more music in you than a fly!” he broke
off abruptly to inform her, then he sat down in
her place and roared in velvet with magnificent
effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame, shaken and reduced from triumph
to the verge of tears, quivered for a little in the
window-seat; but even then her prize was still
within her grasp--Monsieur had simply for the
moment forgotten her. She was capable, if
she had waited, of reminding him successfully.
Alas! she had that fatal longing to help which
reduces the greatest women to the level of a
nuisance. She could not let herself be forgotten
even for a moment--even for his art. She
would go back and turn over the leaves for
Raoul. He frowned, he swore under his
breath, he shook his heavy head at her; but she
went on turning over the leaves--he was not
playing to the score, he did not want his leaves
turned over--her eager, fluttering figure drove
him frantic. In ten minutes he banged the
piano lid down, and threw the score on the carpet.
He told her before Léon, before Rose, in
the drawing-room of the Villa degli Angeli that
she was an intrusive insect!</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a horrible pause. Léon approached
Madame in a state of mingled chivalry
and satisfaction. She was a pitiable figure
as she stood there biting at her dainty lace handkerchief
to keep the tears back; her face was
very white under its layer of powder. Probably
it would have been better if she had sat
down. She simply stood with imploring, helpless
eyes fixed upon the angry tyrant before
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No angry man likes to be looked at helplessly.
Monsieur Gérard glared at her--then
he made the gulf that had come between them
impassable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Understand!” he shouted, turning the music
still on the piano to and fro, as if he were making
hay, “To-night I go to Naples! I cannot
stand more of this! I will go to Naples for one
night, for two--for three! You must remain
here! I go to Naples!” Madame’s eyes went
from her husband to Léon. Léon’s eyes were
fixed on hers in pity, in forgiveness--and were
they also fixed a little in expectation? He
knew, and Madame knew, precisely the purpose
of Monsieur Gérard in going to Naples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose did not understand as much as this, but
she thought it was very wicked of Monsieur
Gérard to go away from his wife on their honeymoon
because she tried to turn over the leaves
of his music.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She got up and crossed the room towards
Madame. It was Rose who put an end to the
unendurable silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon was waiting for a cue from Madame,
and Madame was too stunned to give him any
cue. She was like a little helpless leaf that
has brought on its own storm, but Rose waited
for nothing. She looked first at Monsieur
Gérard. She compelled that enraged artist to
meet her steady, disapproving eyes; then she
held out her hand to Madame Gérard and with
a gracious diffidence that was the perfection of
dignity, she said in her stumbling French, “I
hope very much, Madame, that if your husband
is to leave you for a few days, you will
give us as much of your company as possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame excused herself. She murmured
under her breath that Rose was too kind.
Once more her eyes flickered from her husband
to Léon. “It is a great happiness to
me to second my wife’s invitation,” said Léon
gravely. He murmured something more as
he bowed over her hand and kissed it. Rose
had already turned and without even glancing
in the direction of Monsieur Gérard she went
out into the gay little garden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Capri saw them return to the Hotel Paradiso.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon was remorsefully attentive to his wife;
he treated her as if she were something very
valuable that might break.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps in some subconscious way he knew
that he was going to break her, but he was very
much impressed by her behavior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was, he thought to himself, the soul of
generosity, and when we are sure that we have
the soul of generosity to deal with we sometimes
find it difficult not to take advantage of it.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>he next day Monsieur Gérard carried
out his intention of going to Naples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Gérard remained invisible. She
accepted the flowers Léon called upon her to
present, but she sent down a message that she
was indisposed and could see nobody. She
was indisposed until five o’clock the following
day. By this time she had made up her mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not an easy task. She said to herself
again and again that she would have accepted
heartbreak--but she could not accept
outrage. Her husband had not only cruelly
wronged her--he had done so publicly before
the eyes of a man who loved her--and before
his wife. Her marriage was a false step--it
had been her first adventure--but in her
imagination she had only counted upon adventures
as successes--now she was face to
face with an adventure which had proved a
failure. She could not go back--she could
only go on--and yet she hesitated, for after
marriage, adventures that go on are no longer
innocent. Her husband had left her with a
weapon lying within her reach--from the first
it had occurred to her that she could strike back
with Léon, but with this idea had come another
one, that in striking back she must cruelly
wound an innocent and happy woman. In all
the horrible scene which had taken place the
day before there had only been one moment
less intolerable than the others, and Rose had
given her that moment. She had distinctly
stood by her with an offer of friendship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Gérard spent twenty-four bitter,
sleepless hours considering Rose. At the end
of that time--having come to the decision that
she did not want to hurt her, but that she
wished to do the thing that would hurt her--she
made the further decision that, after all,
it need not hurt Rose so very much. When
she thought of her own unhappiness, a little
distress on the part of other wives did not seem
out of place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She would do her best to shield Rose from
the truth, but she wouldn’t do anything to prevent
the truth taking place. These two decisions
placed her in a better position than Léon.
Léon had decided nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He only knew that he must see this complex
woman, that he must, out of chivalry,
discover what she felt about the incredible
behavior of her husband. He must find out
also--in honor or common kindness--if there
wasn’t in the situation some successful part
for a good friend to play. He drew upon
all his virtues for his reasons. Yesterday
Madame had sharply wounded his <span class='it'>amour
propre</span>; he saw that she had been playing a
game with him. Well, the game had failed,
and yet he was still there; there was therefore
still the possibility of a new game under new
conditions, with the advantage, perhaps, to
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He went no further than that. He wanted,
he assured himself, to go no further. He was
full of consideration for Rose, but he distinctly
wished to see how far he could go.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At five o’clock he found himself admitted.
Madame was already out in the sheltered
wistaria-covered balcony. She lay in a long
chair draped in a soft white robe; there were
pearls round her neck and a little black velvet
band. She looked extraordinarily pathetic
and young and very tired of grief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There were no traces of tears on her little
white face--but she was not the woman to
allow traces of any kind to appear, unless they
were becoming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was kind of you to come,” she said
gently after a long pause. “Forgive me, I
had misjudged you. I thought that you
were playing with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon protested eagerly, how could she have
had such an idea? One did not go about playing
with young and innocent women who were
unhappy. She must not do him so much injustice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He talked for five minutes nobly and
eloquently about unhappy young married
women. Madame Gérard listened, looking
between the wistaria branches towards the sea.
When he had quite finished she said gently,
“And yet it was a plot between you and my
husband--your friendship, your attention to
me--they were not very real, Monsieur. You
had agreed with him to win me over to his
wishes. Is that not so?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon was upset. You can never be sure
what a husband will not tell a wife, even an
estranged and angry husband. There is a terrible
habit of indiscriminate confidence in marriage.
Léon had come across it before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He would have eagerly denied conjecture,
but it would not do to deny a confidence; besides
he was secretly much relieved at this
new version of things. He had been afraid
that Madame had been playing with him; it
appeared now that he had been playing with
her. What had happened yesterday was
merely a charming little feminine <span class='it'>revanche</span>.
He began to find the part he was playing
more attractive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is true,” he said at last, “your husband
told me that your marriage was not happy--and
to begin with perhaps I had the idea that
it lay with you to make it so. Forgive me,
this idea soon passed. It passed before the
affair of the other day showed me the incredible
<span class='it'>lacheté</span> of Raoul. Permit me to say
that his behavior shocked me to the heart; but
before this shock took place I had learned in
what light to consider you. Believe me, I have
not been playing with you. I am in earnest,
in terrible earnest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned her eyes to his. They were not
beautiful eyes like Rose’s--but he did not
know them so well, besides she used them
better. “You are really in earnest, really,
Léon?” she asked him searchingly. He
sprang to his feet, but with a wave of her hand
she motioned to him to remain where he was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder,” she said very softly. “I do
not want to be twice deceived, to be deceived
once is to go broken-winged through life, but
to be deceived twice, could one live at all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I swear that I have not deceived you--that
I will never deceive you!” cried Léon passionately.
“The feeling that I have for you
is real--it is intense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still he meant to stay at Capri; he hadn’t
any idea of doing anything else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are prepared,” she asked him, “to
prove your words to me? You realize if I
believe them what is at stake for me--and if
you realize that, do you not think that I have
the right to ask you for a proof?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall not ask me for one!” he cried.
“Rather I will give you <span class='it'>all</span> the proofs in my
power--one or a dozen--what you will--you
have only to ask!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are very generous,” she said with her
pretty irony. “One will be enough. I want
you to-night to take me to Naples. I cannot
stay in Capri until my husband returns. I
will not return alone to France. It appears
that we made a mistake in not going to Naples
for our honeymoon. Let us then--you and I--rectify
this mistake.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon said nothing. He gripped at the little
wooden balcony railing with both hands,
and stared with blank eyes at the laughing
sea. Leave Capri! Leave Rose! His heart
shuddered within him--with every honest
fiber of his nature, and he had many honest
fibers in his nature, he loved Rose. He did
not love the woman before him--but he had
sought what she offered--how could he refuse
it? It was true he had expected to make his
own terms, but this would not be very easy
to explain to her. Still, he tried hard to keep
the situation in hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have said,” he began at last, “that I considered
your husband, in leaving you, to have
committed the worst of infamies. You are
asking me to commit the same.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame raised her eyebrows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You mean in leaving your wife?” she asked.
“After what you have allowed me to suppose,
I had not thought you would have that feeling.
Nor would it be necessary for you to act
as my husband has acted. But I am supposing,
of course, that what you feel for me is--real.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pardon me, Madame,” said Léon firmly,
“all that I have said to you is true--and yet--is
it incredible to you?--I love my wife!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame smiled at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You know how children play with daisies?”
she said. “As they pull off the little white
petals one by one--‘He loves me--a little, very
much, passionately, not at all.’ It is funny
what comes after passionately--so soon after,
Léon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He stirred uneasily. Madame began to
pull to pieces a spray of wistaria, throwing the
blossoms one by one smilingly into her lap.
“I do not ask you, my friend,” she said slowly,
“for the devotion of a lifetime--there are
hardly enough to go round of these blossoms--we
must not stop at passionately, must we--we
must stop at not at all! I was thinking
of spending three days in Naples.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you would expect me to leave you in
three days?” asked Léon reproachfully. He
watched her feverishly. A man must know
what he is in for. “In three days,” said Madame,
throwing all the silvery mauve blossoms
with a quick little gesture over the balcony, “I
should insist upon your leaving me.” As she
did this her small, firm hand touched his. He
caught it to his lips and kissed it fervently.
The smile in her eyes deepened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She supposed he must have stopped thinking
of Rose, but he said again, after a
moment’s pause, “To leave her--to leave her--that
seems somehow very base!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then do not leave her,” said Madame
wearily, withdrawing her hand. “Break your
word to me, it is very simple. I have no claim
on you--I am not your wife.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are everything in the world to me,”
he said desperately. For the moment he believed
she was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She leaned forward a little.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After all,” she said, “your wife will not
know why you go to Naples. You have only
to say you go on business. She is so innocent
she will believe you--you might even tell her
that you are to act as my escort back to my
husband. She need not suffer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon flung back his head. “But,” he stammered,
his eyes filling with sudden tears, “I
cannot lie to Rose! She is not like that! I
cannot lie to her--it is as you say, she would
believe me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah,” said Madame, “let us hope then that
you can lie about women better than you can
lie to them! But you are making a mistake.
It is very easy to lie to us. All men have
found it so.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pushed her words away from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Elise,” he asked her suddenly, “do you
care for me? This thing that you are about
to do, is it from your heart?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She rose and stood beside him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will give you the proof,” she said in a low
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But still he was not satisfied; his eyes continued
to question her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is from my heart,” she repeated firmly.
He caught her to him and kissed her, but it
seemed to him even then as if he held something
dead in his arms, something which by no
beat of the heart, by no single spiritual response,
met his. She gave him her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a long moment he held her, then she
withdrew herself and moved away from him.
“No more,” she said gently. “To-night I
shall expect you. I will meet you at the turn
of the road by the Madonna of the Rocks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She moved with him slowly towards the
door. “<span class='it'>Voyons!</span>” she said before they parted.
“Don’t hurt her--don’t ever tell her--your
young wife. She is too good. A lie will cost
you nothing. And, after all, if it was not me--it
would be some other woman soon--would
it not? After all--” Her voice faltered.
Something in her wavered for a moment, something
very hard and deep, tried suddenly to
melt. “After all,” said Léon gravely, “this
is the greatest proof I have to give. Take
it as generously as I give it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked at him with strange eyes. “We
are both about to be very generous, are we
not?” she said with a dry little smile. “<span class='it'>Eh
bien!</span> Love is short and marriage is long--all
the better for love--which sees its end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon did not like this point of view. There
was some truth in it, no doubt, but it would
have sounded better from the lips of a man.
He kissed her hands reproachfully. He could
not think for the moment of anything very
beautiful to say about love, and Madame herself
said no more. She simply looked suggestively
at the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After he had gone she stood where he had
left her, clenching and unclenching her small,
firm hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“From my heart,” she whispered, “<span class='it'>Mon
Dieu</span>--it appears so--from my heart.”</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>R</span>ose was finishing a letter to Agatha
on the balcony. She found it difficult
to write to her sisters, they seemed so very far
away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was afraid, too, that they might find
her letters dull. You couldn’t go on describing
the blue grotto; besides, neither Agatha
nor Edith cared for descriptions of scenery,
they always skipped them in books; and as far
as Rose could tell nobody played any particular
game in Capri. Young men shot birds
on Sunday afternoons when they could, but
they weren’t even the proper birds to shoot,
so perhaps it was better not to mention them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Rose wrote to her people she always
said “we” even when she was referring to
things that she did by herself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It wasn’t very like a Pinsent to give way
to this illicit expansion of fact, but Rose comforted
herself by thinking that after all, editors
said “we” when there was only one of them
writing, and most of the married people she
knew expressed themselves in the plural,
though that perhaps was because they really
did the things together. Still, she went on
writing “we” because she didn’t want her
people to think anything funny about Léon.
She had just got as far as “We have such jolly
little dinners in the garden,” when she heard
Léon’s whistle coming up the stairs. He
stood looking at her a little curiously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are writing,” he asked her, “to your
people?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To Agatha,” she said. “Have you any
message?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon sometimes sent very amusing messages
to Agatha. For a moment Léon did not
reply, then he said, “And what do you say to
them--of me--your people?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose blushed, just the same wonderful pink
tulip blush Léon had from the first particularly
admired, but it was ill-timed, it looked guilty.
It shot through his uneasy mind that she had
been complaining of him to the Pinsents. In
his irritable, resentful state it gave him a sudden
sense of justification. Hadn’t he done
already wonders for Rose? He had not made
open love to Elise (until just now, of course),
he had borne for over a month the ennui of
Capri. He hadn’t so much as been to a café
without his wife, and now he had almost decided
not to leave her!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell them,” he said bitterly, “that you are
perfect, and that I am a monster of depravity.
Almost all wives say that to their relatives
sooner or later. You, it appears, have taken
up the tone in good time!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Léon!” she cried, aghast. And then, because
she loved him so, because she had shielded
him in the defiance of truth, because she had
never had a suspicion of his faithlessness, she
chose this moment to say the only harsh thing
she had ever said to him. “I think,” she said,
turning away her eyes, “that you are guilty
of very bad taste.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was, of course, the one fatal reproach to
make to a Frenchman. If she had said he was
guilty of anything else he would have forgiven
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon rushed into their room, his cheeks on
fire as if she had struck him. It was clear
she no longer loved him! Coldly, cruelly, with
her horrible English justice, so out of place
in a woman, she had thrown this stone at his
heart! There could be but one issue now.
He must go to Naples. She complained of
him to her parents and she had accused him
of bad taste! He packed a small bag feverishly.
The door between them was shut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose hesitated. Should she open it and tell
him she was sorry?</p>

<p class='pindent'>What would Agatha or Edith do, if they
were there? Probably they would have burst
open the door with shouts of glee, and inserted
a cake of soap down Léon’s back, but this
happy method of conciliation seemed closed to
Rose. She had never had their robuster gift
of horseplay. She got up hesitatingly and
walked slowly away, out into the garden and
beyond the gates to post her letter. Perhaps
when she came back for dinner she might have
thought of something nice to say, something
that would show Léon she was sorry and not
aggravate him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a lovely evening. She wandered on,
seeing at every fresh turn of the road a yet
more glorious view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The great bay spread before her like an endless
liquid flame. The color seemed to throb
upon its burnished shield.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Naples lay beyond it, a long pearly circle
in the evening light, pale cream and coral pink
and soft, dull gold. Above Vesuvius the white
plume of smoke drove straight as a lifted
feather up into the sky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She went on till she reached the Madonna of
the Rocks, then she sat under the tall raised
figure with its lamp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the turn of the road below her a little
carriage was standing; in it was the figure of a
woman in white. The figure reminded her of
Madame Gérard, only it could not be Madame
Gérard, of course, because Madame had
written to Rose that she was not well and could
not leave her room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Rose sat there her eyes filled with tears.
They were not for herself, though her own
heart was sore; they were for the poor woman
whose husband had so cruelly left her all alone
on her honeymoon. And when Rose thought
how happy she was herself, and how soon she
would tell Léon, with her cheek against his
cheek, that she was sorry she had been horrid,
her heart ached for that other bride who had
no lover to appease; and who must be looking
at all this great sparkling sea and wonderful
bright earth with such sad, different eyes!
And so Rose sat there and cried for Madame
Gérard--and Madame Gérard, two hundred
yards away, waited for Rose’s husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He came at last, hurriedly, quietly, with
hanging head, like a thief. He was ashamed,
ashamed of his anger against Rose, of his incredible
folly, of his silly, intemperate desires.
He passed close by the rock on which Rose
sat. Her heart moved suddenly against her
side; it betrayed her; stubbornly it beat as if
it knew itself in danger, and yet, Rose said
to herself, there was no danger. It was only
Léon hurrying by, looking as if he were
ashamed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She saw him get into the little carriage, and
then turn and look back. She could not see
his face, but it seemed to her as if he were
reluctant to be driven away. Of course he
would be back for dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps, after all, that was Madame
Gérard, and Léon was driving her down to the
eight o’clock boat? Probably she was going
to Naples to join her husband, and Léon had
offered to see her off. He would be very late
for dinner. If she hadn’t been cross he would
have told her what he meant to do. The little
Capri ponies plunged forward and the carriage
disappeared in a cloud of dust. A long while
after she saw the little steamer pushing its way
across the crystal sea and leaving behind it a
long purple trail. She watched it till it lost itself
beyond Castellamare. Léon would soon
be back now. She walked slowly towards the
hotel and when she got there she was conscious
of something strange about it. The Padrone
met her with a bunch of flowers, and the stout
Padrona bustled out from the office to ask Rose
if there wasn’t anything extra she would like--would
she not dine now in the garden?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no, not now,” Rose said quickly. “I
will wait for my husband.” A shadow passed
over the Padrona’s face. She hesitated and
then said with urgent kindness, “The Signora
has only to ask for anything she wants.” The
waiter, too, looked at Rose with strange,
sympathetic eyes. He suggested her feeding
the pigeons, and hurried to offer her new bread
off the table of some traveling Germans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These people,” he said, “Tedeschi will not
know the difference. Take it, Signora mia,
for your birds.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pigeons had already gone to roost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peppina, the chambermaid, watched Rose
from the balcony. She should have been at
her supper, but she stood for some time gazing
down into the garden at the figure of the young
wife. Suddenly she also bethought herself of
something and hurried down into the garden
carrying a black kitten in her apron which she
deposited on Rose’s lap. “Behold,” she said,
“the little one of fortune. A black cat brings
luck. Talk to it, Signora, perhaps it will stay
with you.” But the black kitten jumped off
Rose’s lap. It wanted to play with its own
shadow in the grass, and to stalk birds. It was
not too young for that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sky changed slowly from rose color to
a clear, pale blue. One by one the stars came
out, but they made no place in the sky, till the
evening waned and night came, velvety and
black, to Capri, embracing it like a dropped
mantle, and then, through the curtain of the
mysterious dark, the stars grew enormous and
shone down upon the scented lemon gardens
and over the vague wide sea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Outside the gate a mandolin struck up a
hungry, empty little tune.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose shivered and moved back into the
house. She could not bear the beauty of the
garden any more alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Padrona met her with a letter in her
hand. She had had it for two hours, but she
could not make up her mind to give it to Rose.
“How,” she asked her husband, “am I to slay
happiness?--I am not a butcher.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Signora,” she said nervously, “here is a
little letter--it is doubtless from the Signore.
He is perhaps detained--hospitable friends
have kept him--” Rose held out her hand for
the letter. The Pinsents never made fusses.
They didn’t believe in bad things happening,
and when they happened they tried to look as if
they weren’t bad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the way Rose looked now. She
smiled pleasantly at the Padrona, and moved
slowly away towards her room with the letter.
She would not hurry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Padrona gazed compassionately after
her. “She is walking over a precipice,” said
the Padrona to herself, “as if it were a path in
our garden, Poverina!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a very short letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” Léon wrote in French, “I find
I must go to Naples. It will not be for long
I leave you, and I have told them all to look
after you until my return. Forgive me.
Léon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After all he could not lie to Rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She read his letter three times. The first
two times she translated his letter into English,
and wondered why Léon had gone to Naples.
The third time she read it without translating
it, and then she knew everything. She knew
everything in all the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But she could not quite believe it. The
arrogance in her rose up and fought against
the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose had very little arrogance, but all
women who have been loved must have some.
Surely he who was so much her lover could
not have left her so soon?</p>

<p class='pindent'>She remembered that when she had said to
her mother, “But I could never leave Léon,”
Mrs. Pinsent had made no direct response.
Her mother had realized that that wasn’t the
only question. How had she realized this?
Had her father ever--? Rose buried her face
in her hands and wept bitterly. “Oh, poor
mother!” she murmured, “poor mother!”
She could not see herself as wholly poor yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then she remembered Léon’s face as he
passed her, his sad, ashamed face, and she
knew now why he had left her; but that he did
not want to leave her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat up very straight and stopped crying
when she realized this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She thought it very strange, for she knew
quite well that Madame Gérard didn’t love
Léon, either. She loved her own husband,
Rose had seen this; she knew it as if it were
in the multiplication table; but she couldn’t
think of Madame Gérard now, she wasn’t her
business. Léon was her business. She must
understand, why he had done this thing. It
wasn’t any use being silly and just crying,
then it might happen again, and it should never
happen again; she wasn’t going to have Léon
looking ashamed twice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the first what wrung her heart was
that Léon would feel it so! He had meant to
be such a help, he nearly had been, and if he
hadn’t been wasn’t it because Rose had failed
him? She hadn’t meant to fail him of course,
she had meant just the opposite; but that was
before she knew all about everything, and before
you know how to mean, meaning isn’t
going to be much of a help.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had thought Léon was strong. He
wasn’t strong, but in the rush of her passionate
reasoning she carried this feather-weight
of disadvantage into the fathomless sea of her
love and left it safely there. No, he wasn’t
strong--but he was Léon--he was hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was she who should have realized his
weakness. She remembered now that once or
twice lately he had turned back from his excursions
with Madame to suggest that Rose should
join them, but she had refused in her foolish
pride because she had wanted to prove to him
how magnanimous she was. She shouldn’t
have done that at all, she shouldn’t have had
any pride--and it didn’t matter in the least
whether she was magnanimous or not! She
should have held him to her by whatever could
have kept him there. Tears, if tears were
necessary; pity, duty, pleading--anything and
everything that would have helped him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had been thinking of what he would
think of her--not of what he needed in her!
She saw now it only mattered what he thought
of her in so far as it helped her to save him.
Her magnanimity hadn’t saved him. Something
less beautiful but more practical might
have saved him, her just being, for instance, a
little more there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he hadn’t lied to her, she came back
to that as if it was something on which her
heart might rest. Ah! if he had done that she
would have known that he no longer loved her!</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he had given her no reason--no excuse;
he had flung his sin before her because he was
ashamed, because he wanted his soul to be
naked in her sight--because he knew that she
would never fail him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the dark she caught sight of the hovering
Peppina. “Signora,” Peppina pleaded, “will
you not dine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose stood up. “Yes,” she said in a voice
that sounded strange. “Yes, please, I will
dine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Pinsents always dined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell the Padrona,” Rose said steadily,
“that the Signore has had to go to Naples on
business. He will not return to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Peppina still hovered. “Si Signora,” she
said, “and the black cat, the one I brought to
the Signora earlier in the evening, he has found
for himself the room of the Signora. Behold,
he lies there curled-up on her bed. He is there
now--a miracle! The Signora remembers
that I told her ‘a black cat means good
fortune’?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose hurried into the room, and found him.
He was not quite so good as her fox terrier at
home, but he was a comfort. She buried her
cheek against the round black ball of the
fortunate kitten, and wept with easier tears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she went down and had her dinner in
the garden.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<p class='noindent'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>hey sat on a terrace overlooking the
most beautiful view in the world. They
did not look at it, nor did they look at each
other. They were beautifully dressed, they
lived in the same world and spoke the same
tongue; they would have laughed at, if they
would not have made, the same jokes. The
materials for happiness were heaped before
them; but neither of them stretched out a hand
to take them. They were both like creatures
under an invisible ban.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It could not be said that Léon had any cause
for a grievance. Madame Gérard had given
him what she had offered him, but he had
fatally under-estimated how far this gift would
fall short of what he wanted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the moment of their departure from
Capri it had come over him that Elise was not
beautiful, that she had no particular charm of
person nor of mind; she neither touched nor
soothed him. There was a fatal alteration in
her. She was accessible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon could not tell what had caused this
change in his feelings--he had been covered so
lightly by a rare and perfect tenderness that he
had not realized how it warmed and nourished
him, until he found himself sharply deprived
of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He felt like some one suddenly pushed
into the dark. He fumbled and knocked himself
against obstacles, possessed by an intolerable
fear, a fear that he shouldn’t get out,
shouldn’t ever get back into his light again.
He knew now what the light was, he had been
in relation to perfect purity, and it was not
until the relation ceased that he realized it had
not left him as it found him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He no longer wanted anything less. He
wanted only his flawless jewel, the deep and
incorruptible heart of Rose. And as for the
first time he knew the hunger of a real desire,
he knew also that he shrank from returning
to her after so light and base a sin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He had thought this three days could be
nothing, an episode, a chance wayside plucking
of a flower, something that he could quite
easily put away from him and forget on his
return to Rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He now discovered that it would burn into
his heart like a corrosive fluid, and make him
fear to seek her presence. It was not that he
doubted Rose would forgive him; but he came
up against something in himself which would
not yield forgiveness. He had too easily gone
wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He kept his eyes carefully away from
Madame Gérard. He hated her with a cold
antagonism; he could not make love to her.
He fell back on a sharpened irony of attention.
She should have all that she wanted and he
waited upon her with an exaggerated courtesy;
but she was as oblivious of his coldness as she
had been of his warmth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon had never known so strange a woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As for Madame Gérard, she had effected
her purpose. Last night at the Opera, seated
in the front of a box with Léon beside her,
she had caught and held the eyes of her enraged
husband. That was what she had come
to Naples for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon had not seen him. Monsieur Gérard
sufficiently accompanied to feel that a scene
would have been out of place, had swiftly withdrawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But before he had withdrawn, his eyes had
crossed swords with his wife’s.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After that there seemed very little to do.
She was conscious that the rest of her life lay
before her, and that her husband would never
forgive her. The prospect once accepted,
ceased to stimulate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From time to time she was conscious of
Léon, but never as a consideration requiring
much effort. She had fulfilled her bargain
and nothing more seemed to be asked of her.
She felt with relief that rather less was required
of her than might have been expected,
and she was vaguely grateful to Léon for leaving
her so much alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was a man of tact and could be trusted
to look out her trains for her and see her
eventually back to France. She supposed she
would have sooner or later to rejoin her
parents; but she wished she could forget what
she had done to Rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now that her purpose was accomplished
this fact became more and more troublesome
to her. Léon she had no qualms about, for
she realized neither his unhappiness nor what
she had cost him, but she did realize Rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It made her a little sharp with Léon when
she thought of him at all; but it was quite easy
not to think of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Gérard wanted to ask him if he
had succeeded in keeping Rose unaware, but
she shrank from speaking of Rose. Neither
of them spoke of her, and neither of them
thought of anything else. It made the silence
heavy between them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would like something to eat or drink,
perhaps?” Léon at length roused himself to
ask her. “No,” she said, “thank you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He lit a cigarette and smoked it through,
then he said, “It is, I believe, considered very
beautiful to drive to Posilippo in the sunset--to
dine out there and return. Shall I order
a carriage?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned her head for a brief moment and
glanced at him. She wished he would go away
now--drive to Posilippo by himself, for instance.
“Do as you like,” she said without
stirring, “I stay here--” “Then, of course,”
he said gravely, “I shall not leave you.” It
was like being in prison--and not being quite
sure whether you were the prisoner or the
jailer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a relief to know that some one else
was advancing along the terrace. Léon
sprang to his feet; he was not a clumsy man,
but he very nearly upset the table by which
they sat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose was walking slowly towards them.
She held a Baedeker in one hand and a parasol
in the other. She was very tall, and she looked
taller than usual. Her wide blue eyes rested
on the wonderful sea beyond--but she had seen
Léon and Madame Gérard. She walked towards
them without speaking or smiling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she came up to them she smiled a
little nervously, but in a very friendly way, as
if she was glad to see them both, but didn’t
want, of course, to make a fuss about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They told me,” she said, “that I should
find you out here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Gérard could not rise. Her lips
moved as if she tried to speak, but she dared
not speak. This was her judgment. She was
the cleverest of women, but she no longer knew
what to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon stood there with his eyes on the ground,
white as a sheet and trembling. He could not
look at Rose at all. He felt as if her eyes
were fire from Heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose spoke again. “Léon,” she said, “do
you think I might have some tea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mon Dieu</span>--Rose--” he whispered under
his breath. “<span class='it'>Mon Dieu</span>--what must you
think⁠--”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I could have some roll and butter, too,”
she went on, ignoring his murmur, “it would
be very nice. I am rather hungry.” Léon
turned and without speaking passed quickly
into the house. Rose sat down opposite
Madame and put the Baedeker on the table.
Madame Gérard lifted her heavy eyelids and
looked at Rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She did not know what was coming, but she
meant whatever came--scorn, anger or contempt--to
take it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was not sure what Rose wanted--she
waited to be sure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose met her eyes with a grave and infinitely
kindly look. “I am so sorry,” she said slowly
in her hesitating French. “We meant to help
you, but I’m afraid we didn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame drew a quick breath, she had not
expected this. It had not occurred to her that
Rose would be sorry; that hard, stubborn substance
that was in her breast melted once and
for all towards Rose. The tears filled her
eyes and fell slowly into her lap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear,” she said, “no one could help
me, and I have not even--helped myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was stupid,” Rose went on gently, “and
I didn’t understand; but I do understand now.
What I wanted to say before Léon comes back
was, that I <span class='it'>know</span> he meant not to make things
worse. You <span class='it'>will</span> forgive him, won’t you, because
it was my fault really. If I had understood,
you see, I should have known he
couldn’t help you--not in that way--and I
think I could have stopped him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Gérard nodded. “I have nothing
to forgive your husband,” she said, choosing
her words carefully. “He has done me no
great wrong; always I knew where his heart
was--it is still there, Madame--it is in your
hands. I--” said Madame Gérard, looking
away from Rose’s pitying, tender eyes--“have
what I deserve. I have nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The waiter came with the tea. Léon returned
at the same time. He could not keep
away, and yet it seemed to him as if there
had never been less of him anywhere--his self-respect,
his manhood had left him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose turned to him, and with a little gesture
of perfect tenderness and trust she slipped her
hand over his. It was as if she gave him back
his soul. He drew himself up--strength
passed into him. She had come back, she was
his--somehow or other she was there to save
him, and at least he could be generous--he
could let himself be saved. He no longer
cared that he must be a poor figure in her
sight, and he forgot that there was any other
sight but hers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She withdrew her hand again and went on
very slowly, still in French, including him in
the conversation with a little wave of the
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have just,” she said to Madame Gérard,
“been talking to Monsieur Gérard. He
thinks I have improved very much in my
French.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My husband!” Madame cried, starting
forward, then she sank back, white-lipped and
trembling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” said Rose, “I went to see him. I
found him in the Baedeker. He was in the
sixth hotel I called at.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But why,” began Madame Gérard, “why
did you seek him--Madame, what did you say
to him? Forgive me, I do not understand?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought perhaps I had better see him
first,” Rose explained. “I saw him in the hall.
I think he was in a kind of rage--he said he
had seen you last night at a theater with Léon,
and I said, yes--that I never went to theaters
in Italy because I didn’t understand the
language, and then he asked me if I had been
with you all the time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Gérard held her breath. Her eyes
seemed like a prayer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose turned to Léon. “I’m afraid I didn’t
tell him the truth,” she said hesitatingly. “I
hope it wasn’t very dreadful--I said, yes, of
course I had.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You lied to him!” gasped Léon. “Then--then--”
for the first time he looked at
Madame Gérard. She covered her face with
her hands. Rose looked a little perturbed.
“I didn’t know,” she said, “what else there was
to be done. Of course I know it was very
wrong. I never have been untruthful before.
I--I don’t like telling lies, but I thought--I’d
better. So I said we were all together. I was
a little afraid he mightn’t believe me or that
he might ask me where we were, but he didn’t.
He quite believed me. He only asked me
what I wanted to see him for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Par exemple</span>,” muttered Léon; “he asked
you that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose poured herself out a second cup of tea.
“I said,” she went on, “I came because I
thought you might be sorry for leaving your
wife all alone--just because she tried to turn
over your music for you--and that I thought
perhaps you might be wanting to tell her so--and
not know where she was.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame’s eyes fell from her face. “But
yes--” she whispered, “and what did he say,
Raoul, when you asked him that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a new look in her eyes now, and
a little color in her pale cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He said he <span class='it'>was</span> sorry,” said Rose, gently.
“He said he never would have behaved like
that, and never meant to--it was only the
music, he said, he often lost his head over music,
and that that afternoon he had felt how great
a success his marriage was--so that it was
doubly unfortunate. He said he wanted to
come back to you very much.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a moment’s pause. Madame
Gérard’s voice was quite different when she
spoke now, there was hope in it. “And what
answer did you give him, Madame?” she said.
“I think I can see by your eyes that you gave
him an answer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose nodded. “I told him--I had a feeling
that you would forgive him--and that I would
ask you, if you did, to send him a line to-night--saying
if you would see him, and where, of
course! You see I didn’t know where you
were at the time--but I found you quite easily,
because I had remembered something that
Léon had said to me about this special view.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Léon buried his head in his hands and
laughed wildly. He laughed to save himself
from tears. Madame Gérard said nothing at
all; but she stretched out her hand for the tea
Rose had poured out for her and began to
drink it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rose ate two rolls and a half. “I’m afraid
you’ll think I’m dreadfully greedy,” she explained,
“but I haven’t had any lunch, or any
breakfast either, properly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I,” said Léon, coming from behind his
hands, “I cannot meet Monsieur Gérard to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” said Rose, “but I left my luggage on
the Quay. There is a boat that goes to Venice
to-night, and I thought,” she murmured with
a diffident, disarming smile, “that perhaps you
wouldn’t mind if we just went to Venice,
Léon. It would be more gay.”</p>
